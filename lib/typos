Kalim[1186]: look into disarm and steal if item is cursed
Bioc[6882]: Look at gouge, the chances are slim to none
Solaar[18215]: magic.c in void spell_energy_drain.last 10 lines of code aren't needed.
Solaar[1000]: Ignore the above. A } is in the wrong place to complete the for loop.  Look at spell_frost_cloud
Silak[25543]: giant we
Esper[3040]: the Sanctuaryn Herald says 'But boy are those gods greedy.  Pack your walets to the brim.' wallets
Garath[21004]: 'deserted cottage is missing parts of the description for the painting grate and fireplace'

Elian[10319]: Help Recall needs an extensive updating. You'll see what I mean when it says Zifab and "No recalling tree/poly'd" people :)
Dashed[3005]: lol
