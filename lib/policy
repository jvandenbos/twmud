time.  

SPAMMING is strictly NOT permitted, spamming will probably result in instant

PESTERING the ADMINS is a bad idea.  Anyone asking an admin a question
more than once, or asking a god to load equipment, set your alignment or
anything along those lines is grounds for the admin to get annoyed with you.
You don't want that.

this channel, just type swear while you are in the mud.

Sexual Harrassment is against the law, and will be dealt with accordingly.

If you get upset with something, person or situation, you should log off
for a while and cool off.  Then come back and talk to an Admin about it.

channels will not be tolerated.  It will be dealt with with a freeze/
noshout/ban.
