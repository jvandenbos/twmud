Seraph's Cloud~
You have never felt more tranquil in your entire life...
You are literally floating on a soft blanket of mist overlooking the World of Thieves...
The suns rays penetrate the clouds above and below you...
warming both your face and your soul...
Man, Heaven IS nice.  There is even a phone with speed dial to Domino's.
Yes, they deliver! You can't wait til you have your own cloud someday.
