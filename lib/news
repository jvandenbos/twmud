Hello Thieves World mudders,
Thank you for your patience while we are in the process enhancing your playing 
experience.  There are going to be some changes that are taking place within the 
next month or two.  All of these changes are for the better of the mud.  You all will
continue to get updates from the staff as soon as these changes go into affect.
Below are some things that we are doing for you all at the present moment in 
time:

1.)Currently spell checking all the rooms in the mud.
2.)Improving player skills.
3.)Making the mud more player interactive.
4.)Clans have now been reinstated.
5.)More quests will be run, and in turn with the tokens accumulated
    on the quests can be spent on various things!(See immortal/pc
    board north of fountain for details.)
6.)We are rebuilding Guild Armor for more benefits towards pure classes.

These are just a few of the things we are working on with more still to come


Thanks,
The Admins
