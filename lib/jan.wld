In a dark and spooky chamber~
You are standing in a room, whose only light source is the pulsing red veins
in the black marble walls and floor.  The vaulted ceiling is lost into the
darkness.  The only furniture in the room is a great, ruby-encrusted throne
on a four foot high dias before you.  Seated on the throne is a great warrior
clad in light-absorbingly black plate armor.   The crest on his shield is
simple : <-0->.  He pulls a great huge bastard sword from over his shoulder,
and says, "I'm really a nice guy, you know...what can I help you with?"
It's big, it's purple, and it's right under your nose.

You notice a huge plaque on one wall.
..Among all this you see Infoteq jacked into his computer, 
seemingly oblivious to the real world.  He is in a huge, 
rather comfortable looking chair, that has some red 
silk hanging off the back. Noticing your approach he 
jacks out and taking a handful of Oreos from a large 
bowl next to him, pops one in his mouth.  After savoring 
it to the last crumb, he turns to you and says, "Heya,

A long table is standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by comfortable
chairs. Another table is standing against the north-east wall, with books
spread out all over it and a lagre map of some kind in the center. High above
is a decorated domed ceiling, with a glass mosaic. The room has four large
windows in each of the corners of the world. The windows span from ceiling to
floor and you can see all of the world from here. A pleasant warm light is
shining through the large windows, and a feeling of finaly being home fills
you. The rush for perfection is set aside, and there is suddenly room for
being youself.

but they have been robbed and hi-jacked more times than you have seen days.
The Coach loads then takes off in a blaze of dust, and another arrives to
take its place.  You see a very prominent sign, urging you to read it.
The Coach Driver shouts 'ALL ABOARD!!!!'  His breath reeks of hard
liquor.  The Sanctuary Coach looks as if it can only hold two passengers at

Path Around Troy~
   An eerie feeling transpires to your senses as you walk around the city.
You try not to let the power of fear overcome you since bravado is
much more honored than retreating.  However you still cannot shake the
feeling that someone is watching you.  But alas, it is just a feeling, a figment
of your imagination, or is it?  As you look around, the path lies in a
north-south direction.

The Ivory Altar~
   The people of Troy come here to pray to the almighty gods for their safety
during their time of turmoil.  Flowers of every kind are placed around the
altar which creates a beautifully rainbow of colors and sweetness of smell. 
The altar is void of any type of security since it is protected by the gods.
You may leave down to the garden or east to go behind the altar

Entrance to the Throne Room~
   You stand south of the actual Throne Room of King Prospero.  There are many
guards posted here for the king's security, many of them wield pikes twice as
long as a man.  The many torches stopped being planted here and replaced with
lavish lanterns.

this castle.  Guards armed with pikes welcomes any unwanted visitors with
hostility.  The many lanterns posted on the walls here now illuminates the room
with an eerie green glow.  There is two candles on each side of the King's big
stone seat.  King Prospero sits on his chair with a robe of the king with the
insignia of Prospero on the right shoulder.

   A fountain rests dead center of this room, it springs forth a clear cool
water that refreshes you.  You look closer to the waters and you see, the
memories of your past adventures, the times you had venturing dungones, times
you were happy, times you were sad, and times you were angry.  You put your
hand out to touch the cold water.  It felt like an angel's touch, and you you
tasted the water.  The cool refreshing taste makes you look at the courtyard
and admire its beauty.

you decide to assassinate a castle inhabitants.  To the west is the Library or
study where Delsenora often studies.  You notice that the King seems to be
always pissed off at the neighbouring rulers because there are many paintings
of other rulers with a dagger stuck on their eyes.

Library~

a table.  Beside her is Janus, they seem to be enjoying spending time with each
other.  You take a few books and study them.  In them, the knowledge of this
castle was divulged : The King was once an adventurer braving the dungeons
located in the world.  He finnaly accumulated enough money and treasure to
create a castle.  He was proclaimed King by a few of the greater rulers nearby.
The King enjoyed his power greatly and in return gave offerings to the other
kings.  To Prospero's surprise his offerings brought him nothing but the other
ruler's soldiers trying to siege his castle.  His love for his daughter was
what kept him a wise ruler.

on a circle-shaped red rug.  On the table is a map of the forest.  You study it

should rest here until they've recovered from their wounds.

is a window here, it overlooks a large forest, and the Quicklings hideout.  
The cabin structure here seems to be fortified with ranger/druid magic, and it
seems that it will serve you well for now.  On the far corner of this room, the
owner of the cabin, or what's left of him rests.  A skeleton of a human sits,
the only relic that he held in his hands was a locket.  Janus looks at the
skeleton and takes it outside for a proper burial.

It is a great stone door barely distinguishable from the surrounding
rock. Even for Trolls it is heavy, but you may be able to open it wide
enough to make an exit... if you have the key.

A Hidden Trail~
   Carefully searching the area, you discover an obscured path leading
east. The Trolls have craftily concealed this trail, and it is only by
chance that you happened to discover it. You plunge eastward through
the dense vegetation of the path...

Dreary Hills~
   You are travelling through hills which grow ever higher, while dark
trees crown their heights and run down their sides. On some of the hills
are RUINS of an evil looking CASTLE, remnants of a long forgotten age. The
sounds of rough water can be heard from the east, while to the south is
the edge of the Lonelands.

are few if any people, no inns, and the roads grow steadily worse. To the

while the road to the west leads to the Shire lands.

   You are walking along a road considerably less travelled than those of
the Shire. The lack of heavy traffic has allowed grasses and small plants
to take root, making the road rough to travel. Looking eastward you see the
rising hills of the Lonelands, while to the west are the more hospitable
looking lands of the Shire.

dark and grey despite a few patches of sunlight on their sides. Hidden
somewhere between here and the mountains is the fair valley of Rivendell
where Elrond and his Elves live in the last Homely House, while to the west
lie the hills and forests of the Lonelands.

floor. In almost all directions, large trees and dense vegetation block your
passage. On a hill to the north, through a dark mass of trees, you make
out what appears to be the soft glow of a fire. The only exit 'seems' to
be north from where you came...

   Looking about there seems to be no trees and no valley and no hills to
break the ground before you, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to
meet the feet of the nearest mountain, a wide land the color of heather
and crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green
showing where water might be. The Wilderlands continue to the north, while
to the west is a river bank.

The Brick Wall~
The way east is blocked by a newly bricked-up wall.  There are
a few HOLES you can peek through to see what is on the other side.
The moaning you hear makes you a bit nervous, but you see no other
alternative but to find a way through.

door to be opened from the other side, if only you could get through.

On the Platform~
   Fire and flame shoots up from out of the running lava.  The way it is
dancing, you almost think its alive.  The flames seem to follow you around,
making you wonder just how natural this volcano is.  The smell of sorcery is
about.  Looking north and west, you can see down to the bottem of the volcano.
There must be a way down there.  You will have to keep looking.

The River of Lava~
   You have landed on a rock in the middle of the river of lava.  This is the
bottom of the inside of the volcano.  The river circles around a small island,
if you can call it that, though the island is too high up for you to reach.  
There must be a way to get up there, but you can't see it from here.

In the Shack of the Volcano~
   You are inside a small shack.  The interior is very bare.  There is a hole
in the floor, big enough for you to squeeze through, and a strange glow coming
from it.  You realize that this is the home of a great sorcerer.  You look
again and find yourself in a lavish dwelling, larger, it seems, than the
volcano itself.  You hear a voice laugh and say, 'Come on down here.  I've been
expecting you'.

stands up from the desk he was working at and GROWS TO THE SIZE OF A LARGE
HOUSE!!!  He laughs and says 'I am dissapointed that my fire beasts have not
dispatched you, but killing you myself will be just as much fun'.

Immortal Hall of Rules~
                        RULES FOR IMMORTALS
1.  Do not aid mortals except in the execution of your duties: i.e. no passing
 out experience, gold, items, information, or other help unless it is part of
 a reimbursal, quest, or other appropriate activity.  This includes aid to 
 YOUR characters as well as to other players.
2.  Do not interfere with mortals so as to harm them, to piss them off, or 
 in any other way take away from their fun.  If you are not qualified to deal
 with problem mortals, get someone who is, don't botch an attempt at raw
 justice.
3.  Your mortal characters are still you.  What you do with them is not to be
 separated from what you do with your immort.  Do not pass out exp like candy
 by allowing others to follow you.  A little aid in recovering from death, or
 getting up to 5th level is ok.  This is not a popularity contest.

Immortal Hall of Rules~
                                         RULES FOR IMMORTALS
4.  Reimbursal is to be conducted only by 53rd and higher level gods.
Do not pass out slews of limited gear.  Do not pass out millions of
experience unless you are darn sure you know they deserve it.  People
with 0 gold likely died or ran out of rent, and probably don't
 merit a reimbursal.  People who lose link in battle or hit death traps are
 not entitled to a reimbursal.  You may, however, show partial mercy in these
 situations; use JUDGEMENT.  If you catch people lying to you during reimbursal
 show them no mercy, and notify a higher authority immediately.
5.  Quests may be run by any god, but be reasonable in the rewards you hand out.
 Examples of excessive prizes are levels, limited items, privileged information,
 and increased ability scores.  Note that this list is not exhaustive.
             CONSULT WITH A GREATER GOD ON THE PROPER PRIZES TO AWARD!!!
6.  Please note the listed responsibilities for immortals of your specific
 rank.  Executing these well, and displaying maturity and trustworthiness are
 the best ways to get promoted on this mud.

7.  It is impossible to anticipate every situation you may face; if you have
 a question about the rules or are unsure what your actions should be, ask
 any greater god.
LESSER GODS (levels 51-55)
 You are in charge of leading the mud.  When things get out of hand, use your
 influence to calm people down.  Settle disputes between players.  Answer
 questions people have about the mud (within reason).  Work on creating your
 area, and learn about those parts of the mud you didn't see as a mortal.
 Contact a higher level immortal for problems with players that are beyond
 your ability to solve.
 You are the mainstay of the immortal force here on the mud.  Reimburse players
 who suffered loss through the fault of the mud, and punish players who violate
 the rules.  Show the ropes to newer gods.

GREATER GODS (levels 56-58)
 You have extensive experience as immortals on the mud, and therefore also
 have greater responsibilities.  Settle troublesome disputes between players.
 Make the calls on tougher reimbursals, and handle tricky players.  Use SNOOP
 to keep an eye on mortals.  Assist the implementors and the other gods by
promulgating and explaining  policy.  Use advanced powers to aid other gods in
the execution of their  duties.  Do "behind the scenes" work on the code.

A small clearing~
   You have been trasnported into a small clearing in a dense
forest.  Thick birch and willow trees block every possible exit
with branches that seem to move in your way every time you
try to leave.  An old stump sits in the middle of the clearing
with parchments that read top secret plans laid upon it.  Dew
collects on the grass at your feet getting them a little damp,
as the warm sun above shines down upon you.  A sense of peace
and welcome overcomes you like never before and you know you
will be safe here.

colors all around you, but when you focus on one, it all turns to grey.

noticable source.  To the north you can see the sun setting behind a magificent
arch of stone.  Behind you the pathway has turned to a cloudy mist.

some writing along the inner side.  It looks like a warning.

you, but there is no way you could pass through the fog to the north and south
of you.  It is as if it is leading you into the heart of the land.

is much warmer than east of here.  There is a fire glowing in the fireplace in
the south wall.  The heat is comfroting in such a place as this.  It is the
first natural light, along witht he torch, that you have seen in this land.  
There is an open door to the north.  There is mud on the floor, in which a very
large footprint was left.  You can feel the cold air of the walkway to the
east.

lining the north and south of this path.  The string of orbs gives off an eerie
light.  There are few plants in this part of the path, but you can see some
green leaves to the east.  To the west you can see the back of the hut.

eastern edge, there are some larger stones with writing on them.  They seem to
be headstones, giving the names of childred passes away.  The wind, doesn't
seem to touch this place, nor the dust or dirt of the path.  There are no
footprints on these stones.  As you look down, you see that your feet are
clean, and free of mud.  The lights continue to the east, while the path is off

The rose seems to be the only color in this corner of white stones.  You can
feel the memories of those past away and layed to rest in this ground.  There
seems to be eyes watching you very closely.  Not in a menacing way, but with a
childlike curiosity.  The stones end to the south, while they continue to the

pushing up against it from the other side.  Some are looking, some seem to be

souls, balancing those resting in the beds of white stones.  The feeling of

All around you the walls are lit up with a magical glow.  There are trees to
the north and east of you.  They have a liveliness to them, unlike the pathway
behind you.  The air is lighter here, and the winds have a sweet smell to them.
It is hard to believe that such beauty can reside in such a place as this.  
Hanging from a tree to the north is a sign.  The sign reads: BEYOND LAY THE
BODIES OF THE GREATEST WARRIORS THE WORLD WILL EVER SEE.  A LAND OF NEUTRALITY
WAS THEIR GOAL.  THEY GAVE THEIR LIFE, AND WILL TAKE ANY LIFE THAT DARES ENTER
THIS PLACE UNWANTED.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!  BEHOLD THE SACRED ALKIAN

A Misty Burial Ground~
   It is very dark....  The world is spinning and so is your head.  The fog is
dense, making it hard to see where you came from.  The rows seem to come in
from the south, north and west though.  Everything seems to be swirling around
you.

A Misty Burial Ground~
   It is very dark...  Before you are the first live people that you have seen
in this burial ground.  There are children with their father, visiting their
mother's honored grave.  They do not cry, they raise there heads high, proud of
the mother that gave her life in battle, fighting the Alkian battles.  More
headstones lead off in all directions.

A Misty Burial Ground~
   It is very dark....  As you enter farther into the sacred burial ground of
the Alkian warriors, you feel more and more eyes watching you.  There are
images passing before you of death, decay, and honor?  It is hard to tell what
is real and what is going on within your head.  And through it all the
headstones lead you on in all directions.

You can hear blades being sharpened off to the north.  There are three
headstones that have fallen out of their row.  Each one is pointing in a
different direction.  None are pointing to the south.  The rows continue.

place where the Alkian Gods dump the bodies of those that run past their
warriors, dishonoring those pasted away.  There are spirits here to gather the
valued items, and wolves to clean the corpses.  There is another room very
similar to this to the north, while the mist covers the south.

of struggle here.  This is your last chance to turn back and go the other way.
To the north is the room of death for those that choose to run through, and not
visit with the warriors, dishonoring the ones that have pasted on.  They do not
treat invaders that dishonor their grounds very nicely.  I REPEAT!!!  DO NOT GO
NORTH!!!  The road to the south will return you to the proper, challenging,

   You really shouldn't run through, it is not polite.  You have entered the
room of death.  All along the walls are the bodies of those that ventured into
this land rushing by.  Once you enter, you cannot leave this room.  Not alive
anyway.  There are bloodstains all over the walls, floors, and roof.  You can
see the head of a man you knew once.  It looks kinda like Tanga's face, though
it is hard to tell with all the scratches and blood it is sitting in.  Slow
down next time...  And you won't have this problem.

regardless of their stone bodies.  The stones have changed from a glimmering
white to a pitch black, from when you entered this place.  As you look around,
you realize there is no turning back.  The mist has cut off all pathways but to
the north.  As you look up you see a portal leading to the entrance of the
burial grounds.

There is only one headstone here, which is a bit weird.  The name on the
headstone is unreadable, but the years show that he wasn't old at all.  He was
7 years old when he died in a battle?  And he is honored with a burial of this
type at such a young age.  He must have been quite a fighter.

is a pot of stew brewing.  The creature can't be far from here.  The dome cover
returns you to the east, while the mist is overtaking to the north and west.

magical creature, that enhanced the weapons, so as not to break, nick, or dull.
This seems to be true, because even the discarded blades here are razor sharp.
But where is the creature????

realizing you really don't want to leave.  She keeps you from noticing her
lover and master, who is sitting in a chair behind the door you just came

get blurry.  To the east and west the walkway continues.  To the south the mist
blocks all visibility.  The walkway is blocked to the west however.

ground around the altar is stained red from all the blood shed.  There is a
sacrifical dagger laying on the altar.  You can see that there is still blood
dripping from it.  Off to the east and west there is a white stone path.  To

Alkian warrior that fell to less than 10 warriors.  They are a match for the
best, and the Grand Masters were the best of the best.  They did not lead with
words, but with Actions.  They lead every battle, riding at the front of
battles.  They lay incased in crystal casings, formed by the Grand Master of
Magic.  Their bodies will be perserved forever, while their spirits will guard
this place from all, good or evil.

The Portal of Transportation~
   You have entered into a portal of teleportation.  The walls are very shiny.
There is a glow around the room illuminating all the things in here.  Hmm...  
Wonder where you will show up?  Oh well, can't leave now.

Novak's Room of Neutrality~
   This room could use a description.  Everything is gray....  Kinda neutral
lookings.  But on each wall there is a different face of evil or good.  
Balance is everything.  Can't have good without evil.  Can't be neutral without
having both.

Temple of Shima~
The Godess of lust and beauty; Shima's Temple makes your body quiver with 
warmth and longing. Through the open dome an illusion of heaven satiates 
your senses. The country of the gods, every breeze bear a different perfume. 
The robes of the immortals are dyed with liquid jewels; they shine in a 
lambent light. You stand, shaken by longing for the velvet meadows and 
aquamarine skies.

Temple of Siveni Gray-Eyes~
Lightning whip the temple's marble, scarring it black. Screeching, a silver 
raven flap out from between a pair of columns and perch complaining in the 
topmost branches of a golden-appled tree lining the entrance. At the end of 
the white, marble hall is Siveni's great statue in her aspect as Defender, 
seated, armed and helmed, holding her battalion vanquishing spear in one 
hand and her raven perched on the other.

statue siveni~
The great work, the statue that the artist Rahen spent five years fashioning 
of marble, gold, and ivory, afterward putting down his sculptor's tools 
forever and saying he knew his life's masterwork when he saw it, and would 
make no other.

Temple of Father Ils~
You are standing in the golden Temple of Ils, father to all Ilsigi gods. 
Vacant of furniture, except an altar of purest gold, and above it on the far 
wall, a painting. Depicted, a scarlet Sikkintair that soar above the heads 
of feasting gods, the transcendent splendor of the Face of Ils, the grace 
Eshi pouring wine, and beside her is seated Thilli, or is it Theba..

carpets and gilt furnishings; all included in a spell-circle, a spell that 
retrieves timelessness as well as time. The light of yesterday, and 
tomorrow, is available to you - through the eyes of the Godess of Purity and 
Love.

You stumble inside the wildly decorated Temple of the Fish-Eyed Beysibs and 
their sole Godess - Mother Bey. With your fall comes the light, blazing in 
through the temple's high narrow windows like the sky splitting; and the 
thundercrack, one deafening bolt that reverberate over the roofs of 
Sanctuary - breaking what glass remain unbroken in the temple's windows, and 
jolting loose what is already shattered, raining it all down on the greenish 
marble floor in a storm of razory chimings. Then stillness again.

Temple of Novak~
In the blinding light inside the Temple of the departed God Novak, you can 
barely see the book you read from, the stone walls around you; they seem 
ephemeral as things dream. You set to work; drawing a complex diagram, 
seemingly a picture of some kind of geometrical solid, though one in which 
the number of sides seem to change each time one counts them. The finished 
diagram makes an uneasy flickering in the mind, a feeling that get worse as 
you start setting the necessary runes and words into the pattern's angles. 
'The Upraising of the Lost, that is to say, an infallible spell for finding 
the lost and strayed and stolen..'

At the edge of a storm~
Before you is a sight that truly reminds you of your insignificance in the face of the greater powers.  Before you is an enormous ethereal storm, an explosive
combination of color and motion.  The conduit your travelling has just about
broken up totally, but it does indeed travel into the storm.
However, you have no idea to tell where the path leads, or even if its one you
can return on.

This is a small stone cavern.  The walls are flecked with some odd orange flecks
and your magical weaponry seems to dim in the room.  A MASSIVE door exits south into the mountains moreso, and it is covered with magical runes.  Oddly, the
door seems well used and unlocked.  You get a strange sense of familiarity from
it.

As you wander amongst the hill paths, you stumble upon another fraying of the

menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go the way you've come. A small path leads north into the
shadows and back south to the river.

A corridor~
  You are in a long corridor leading north and south. Obsidian walls 
engraved with ancient runes of power stretch out before you.  Magical 
energies seem to crackle with power all around and whisper in
tongues long forgotten, almost as if the corridor itself were alive.

The end of the corridor~
  You are at the end of a long corridor. The obsidian walls come to an
abrupt halt at the edge of a golden archway here. The hum of power is so
strong it nearly numbs your body.
  The archway lies before you, glowing and pulsing with energy.

An intersection~
  You are at an intersection of several hallways. You feel as if strange
mystical forces are pushing and pulling at each other from all around you.
The sensation of being trapped, in the middle is almost tangible in the air
here.  A grey tiled hallway leads south, black tiled east, white tiled
west, and a multi-colored hallway swirling with patterns that remain just
barely unrecognizable is to the north.

guess why. In fact, the only real piece of furniture in here is a small cot
upon which the monk sleeps.

Working Section of Library~
   This Library is either very well stocked or these busy monks have been
copying a few texts and scrolls very industriously! Bookshelves are to the
North and South and the only exit is to the East. Several tables and chairs
are about this section and a desk in on the far wall.

though at any given time there is almost gauranteed to be a few monks here
chanting, praying, or humming. The Monastary Entrance is to the North and to

attacks~
The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per
round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the
probability of getting an extra attack each round. (ie. if you were VERY
lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)
[a few samples: Level--#Att]
 1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25   25--2.50

               BOLD ADVENTURERS!!
   Recently, it seems that some nasty little monsters made a hole in our wall
dowstairs in the Cellar. We soundly trashed them and none of them have enough
courage to enter the Cellar again, however, the Monastary would appreciate it
if you would help us keep their numbers down and fear in their hearts.
   Though the Monastary could easily purge the menace, we just don't feel like
taking the time away from our prayers and training to do this. Any assistance
you provide would be appreciated and you may keep anything you find down
there as a reward for your help.

Ominous Tapestries~
Welcome to Thieves World!

   You appear somehow within an arcane chamber.  Huge hanging tapestries,
each intricately detailed in vibrant colors, cover the featureless walls
of your octagonal surroundings.  Wide square bands of white marble serve
to blur the sharp edges of the walls, giving the room an almost circular
appearance.  Gazing about your surroundings, your eye is drawn upward by
a much larger round tapestry hanging directly overhead, and you struggle
with your balance as you examine the fabric's images.  The growing sense
of wonder which pulls at you is tinged with a dose of trepidation.  The
views about you, while wondrous, are nevertheless quite ominous; these
images are of a truly darkened land.

A spiral staircase leads down from center of the room, with an inscribed
golden plaque attached to its banister.  [look plaque]

but a window looking out upon a strange and darkened land.  You begin to 
examine each separately, enjoying the view they afford.  Nine separate 
windows are here, one above you and one in each of the eight directions.

LOOK North, East, South, West, Up and Down:

plaque~
   Welcome, Adventurers, to the Spectral Gates of Thieves World.  All new
characters enter the game in this brief area prior to venturing to the
Darkhaven Academy and the Realms beyond.  This is a small area (only about
25 rooms total) designed to familiarize newcomers to MUDs with gameplay in
these worlds.  Your task is to explore and collect equipment; if you are
already familiar with MUDs, you can simply follow the path to its end.

You will not enter Thieves World (the main game itself) until you
complete the task at this area's end.

You can look at some items in descriptions to view additional information.
For example, "look tapestries" will tell you things about this room and the
world not obvious at first glance.  Also be certain to look at the actual
items and mobiles <creatures of the world> in the room.  Here, your eyes
are often your best weapon.

Should you have any questions or any comments, type WHO to see Immortals
currently available.  Use tell or newbie to talk with them.

An Unsettling Reception~
   Muted sounds and the scent of cedar assail your senses as you enter this
stately chamber.  Thick carpeting competes with leathered chairs in a bid
for your comfort, and a huge painting of a barren desert occupies the wall
behind a large desk of oak.  Four small luminescent globes float aimlessly
about the room, and you notice that though seemingly free floating these
globes always manage to remain equidistant from one another.  The huge
bust of a fantastical lizard has been set upon the wall, an amazing
hunting trophy of some sort.

Seeing the Forest through the Trees~
   The forest opens up a bit here, without actually giving of itself to field
or stream.  It is as if the forest were allowing you access to see the true
beauty that lies within.  Everything you had missed before, all the sights
and sounds and scents, all come to you now.  Your eyes alight upon a flock
of small purple birds which flutter and flow about the area.  A feathery,
light moss grows on the western side of the trees, giving off a faint,
musty smell, and small beetles work industriously in the moss, moulding it
into a haven from predators.  A gentle splashing sound causes your eyes to
drift northward, to a small pond.

Upon a Desolate Hillside~
   Shattered and blasted stone litters the hillside here.  First glance gives
you the impression that this is the result of volcanic activity, but this
view is rapidly displaced as you gaze upon the ravaged bones strewn along
a section of the hill; a headless skeletal remains of a primitive beast.
The majesty of this huge, winged creature has not been diminished by its
boney state.  As you study the remains, you are amazed by the sheer size
of this beast, as he must have struck true fear into the hearts of those
who slew him.  Charred and shattered, hundreds of smaller bones splay
across the hillside, tangible proof that this great beast fought
fiercely before succumbing to its own death.

bones~
The bones here fit together to paint a vivid picture of a large battle -
man against beast.  The men took losses of their own before the beast was
defeated.  The bones of this creature appear to stretch a good twenty men
long, from neck-top to the tip of its tail, and you can imagine the size
of the missing skull.  Your mind wanders back to the reception area, to
the bust on the wall...

stone~
These stones are less sharp and jagged than those lower on the hill, but
definitely more ravaged.  It appears as if they have been applied to very

Cresting the Hill~
   Burnt and dessicated ground gives way, grudgingly, to a grassy plateau.
Low hanging clouds obscure your view of the surrounding countryside, with
the only visible landmark being a tall tower to the southwest, piercing
through the clouds and disappearing skyward.  Pathways lead off down the
hillside to the east and west, and deep, intermittent rumblings come from
nearby.  Glancing southward you see the likely source - the dark opening
of a cave mouth.

Inside the Cavern~
   Large and darkly shadowed, the uneven form of the walls makes it difficult
to determine the extent of this cave.  Strange shards litter the floor of
the cavern, and fresh marks gouged into the ground in and around these
shards help you to determine just what they are:  remnants of a recently
hatched egg of such enormous proportions the leathery pieces fill you with
a growing dread and caution.  Looking about with care, you easily discover
the skeletal remains of many humanoid creatures.  This barely has time to
register before a sharp rumbling causes you to look up suddenly.

of a wide, glistening gate inlaid with ornately carved runes, each glowing
with a color of its own unique hue.  The size of the gate and its obvious

number of channels you receive. You can get a full list of channels by 
typing CHAN. You may turn off a channel by typeing the channel name.
For example, you can turn off auction channel by type AUCTION and 
you can turn it back on by typing AUCTION. You can also turn off ALL 
your channels by typing DEAF and turn them all on again by typing 
DEAF again. Once you have finished reading your guide, you are ready to 
test your ability to negotiate your way around.

   Going west will take you into another part of the Academy. The test is to
follow all the room descriptions until you can find your way back to this
point. If at any time you become lost, type U to return to this room. Once
you have successfully returned here, please continue to the north to explore
the rest of the Academy.

   There are several special exit types that you may encounter in your travels.
You have experienced open exits and closed doors to this point. There are
also hidden doors. The hidden doors might not be found with the "bump" 
method. Often they will not show up with the "look" method either. These 
exits are found by reading room descriptions, mobiles descriptions and looking
at objects. You are looking for words that stand out, those words will be the
door name. You will also find doors that are locked. You may get past some
locked doors with the knock spell, the pick door skill or bash door skill.
Some doors may only be passed by using the matching key. Other exits you
may find require you to be skilled in climb or affected by the fly spell.
All exits are in real directions that can be abbreviated to the following:
N, E, W, S, U, or D. There are also SOME exits that may use "leave", 
"climb", "enter", or just a word to use. To the north you will experience 
a hidden exit, use the room description to find the door name.

Preparing for Combat~
   The time is drawing near to experience combat.  Directly below you now is
the Chadoyn Pit, the home of a creature which will assist you in learning
how to initiate combat.  The Chadoyn is not aggressive, which means you
must begin the fight.  There are many ways to start a fight, the quickest
way is to type KILL <mob>.  As you gain skills and spells, you may find
many of them are also capable of initiating combat.

Some of the more popular spells used to start an attack are DISPEL MAGIC,
SLEEP, CHARM, BLINDNESS, WEAKEN, CURSE, and FAERIE FIRE.  Some of
the most popular skills used to begin an attack are STEAL and BACKSTAB.

Wands, staves and scrolls may also be used to start fights.

   This room explains about WIMPY, FLEE, and RETREAT as a way to leave

hitpoints reach a set minimum. To set your wimpy, type WIMPY or 
WIMPY <number>. The number being the amount of hitpoints you want 
remaining when you leave the battle. You will lose experience for wimpying 
out of a fight, but the amount of experience lost will generally be less then 
the amount lost from death.
   You may also manually withdraw from a fight with flee. To use flee, just
type FLEE. You may flee out of the fight at any amount of hitpoints. Fleeing
will cost you loss of experience. You may also RETREAT from a fight. This
is done with the skill "retreat".

   Here stands a Chadoyn.  He was captured trying to slaughter the students
of the Academy, and the Immortals decided to spare his life and throw him
in chains for use as a teaching aid.  With him you can practice attacking
and fleeing, but hopefully not dying.  You will also want to make use of
the 'consider' command.  This command compares your level and hitpoints
to that of the creature.  To use here, type 'con chadoyn'.

To use the consider command elsewhere, type CON <MOBNAME>.  It is wise to
ALWAYS consider a mob before fighting it the first time.  This will many
times save your life, as mobs are often a lot more difficult then they
outwardly appear.  Be careful and enjoy your fight.

The Room of Portals~
   This is the portal room which leads to the training hall.  Prepare to be
transferred once your presence is noticed.  It may take a few moments, so
please be patient.  Should you decide you are not ready to face the Chamber 
of Trials, you can return to the south.  You notice a large certificate on the 
wall; at least you have something to read while you wait.

Chamber of Trials~
   Here you will experience your first full combat against MOBILES, also 
known as MOBS. Mobile is the name used for monsters and the like in the 
realms.  All exits, except down, lead to a CAGE mob. Some of these cage 
mobs may be aggressive and will attack you upon entering their room. As 
you kill them, you will gain experience, as well as academy equipment and 
gold. Once you have defeated a mob, type GET ALL CORPSE to loot the
coins and equipment.  You may also type AUTOLOOT or AUTOGOLD. 
Autoloot will take everything from the corpse when you kill it. Autogold 
will take only the gold from the corpse. When you loot a corpse of
equipment, the items are transferred to your inventory. You may suffer
injury during the battle, so return here and type REST or SLEEP. This will 
speed your healing process. When you are finished healing, type WAKE or 
STAND to continue.  If you feel you have to gain, going up the stairs will
return you to the Entrance to Darkhaven Academy.

   As you loot the corpses you will be collecting your equipment, you need to
learn the commands for using your equipment. The commands are: GET, 
DROP, WEAR, WIELD, HOLD, REMOVE, and EXAMINE. To  get a piece 
of equipment from a corpse you type GET <item> CORPSE. To get an item 
from the ground you type GET <item>. To drop a piece of equipment from 
your inventory, type DROP <item>. To wear an item,  type WEAR <item> 
or WEAR ALL. To wield a weapon, type WIELD <item>. You may not 
wield a weapon if you are already wielding one, you must first remove the
weapon you are using. To remove a weapon or item,  type REMOVE <item>. 
Many pieces of equipment may be damaged and repaired. To see the 
condition of a piece of equipment, type EXAM <item>.

   The cage mobs are all named "cage" in addition to their actual name. This
mob can be killed using KILL GNOLL or KILL CAGE. All the other cage mobs
are similarly named. The mobs in the battlegrounds will all be referred to
as "arena" in addition to their name.

   This is the stage of your training where you may begin to feel pangs of
hunger and a parched throat. In other words, you need food and drink.
To the east is the Darkhaven Supply Store. You may purchase water and
some meat. Once you have eaten and drunk, you will be ready to proceed
north.

Darkhaven Academy Supply Store~
This is a regular shop, you type LIST to see what you can purchase and
BUY <item> to make the purchase. Like many other places in the Realms,
you may bribe the storekeeper to give you an item. There are many mobs
in the realms that will sell you keys, items or information in exchange
for a few gold coins. Be sure to look at the mobiles for hints on these
types of programs.

A Stone Corridor~
   In this part of the academy you will learn about the Death Trap, more
commonly known as a DT. A death trap is exactly as its name states, a
room that causes your death. Unlike a regular death, you do not lose
your hitpoints and you do not leave a corpse behind. All the items you
were wearing and carrying are destroyed.  You are then transported back
to the Portal of Creation.  Going west will give you more information 
about death traps.

Slow Death~
   This is what you will see if you stumble into a death trap.  As previously
stated, a DT kills instantaneously and destroys any and all equipment you
have at the time.  Hints as to the placement of a death trap are sometimes
given in the room that preceeds them.  Also remember to use "exit" and
"look" to find these deadly rooms.  Note:  Few DTS are found in the realm.

green ichor. It looks as if it is burning right through. You see a flash

Rolling Hills and Trees~
Undulating hills and scattered patches of forest cover the landscape as
far as the eye can see.  The abundance of life is astonishing.  You take a
deep breath in and savor the clean air as your eyes scan the verdant
scene.  The hills and trees continue to the north, west, and south while
the forest becomes too thick to penetrate to the east.

On the Hillside~
You have worked up quite a sweat climbing this hill.  Scanning the horizon
you see a confuzing maze of hills, valleys, and forest.  The hills and
trees continue to the north, while the hill is too steep to climb in any
other direction.  A small pile of rubble on the hillside draws your
attention.

Entrance to the Den~
After your eyes adjust to the darkness, you begin to make out some dim
shapes.  This wide room appears to have been clawed out of the dirt.  A
low ceiling with roots sticking down forces you to stoop over awkwardly. 
Several passageways lead off in all directions and some light from above
filters through an opening in the ceiling.  You can hear distant barking
and yipping down each of the passageways.

A Tunnel~
The clawed out caverns are interconnected by narrow tunnels you almost
have to crawl through.  *BONK* You whack your head on a root which causes
dirt to cascade down on you, temporarily blinding you.

A HUGE Waterfall~
The mists suddenly clear and you jump sideways and cling to a rock as you
are almost swept off a cliff by a raging waterfall!  There is a huge hole
in the roof of this cavern in which bright light and water pours in from
above and crashes far below you to the east.  This wonder of nature is
absolutely mesmerizing.  You dare to peek over the waterfall and have to
strain to see the jagged rocks below.  They look very sharp.  Now...if you
only had a means of eascaping out through the roof to the realms above...

Good job!  You've managed to ignore the one brain cell of common sense
which was screaming at you and stepped off the edge of a raging waterfall
to plummet to your death among the jagged rocks below.  You wonder if you
will ever be able to repair (if you can retrieve) your equipment.

You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A SMALL SIGN is posted here.  A NOTE is also lying here on the cold earth.

		AREA'S AVERAGE LEVEL:  37

BEWARE!!!   Travellers are advised to stay in groups for safety.
There are 2 VERY challenging mazes in this zone!
It is possible to navigate them, but it may take some time.
		Mahn-Tor's story:
		---------------
   It lies hidden in the frigid arctic midst to the south. He has gathered 
the minotaur masters of several minotaur hordes, and hopes to lead them 
against the soft human and demi-human populations.  Sanctuary is his first 
target! There is also a dark forest and haunted swamp within this zone!
   Rumor has it that ogres and other nasty things inhabit the swamp!!

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

The small intersection in the forest~
The forest path splits here in three directions. Small paths lead to the east,
north, and south. The trees above leave a gap which allows light to fill the
intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

The edge of the forest and hills~
You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A path leads north into the forest and
its deadly darkness and silence. Looking west, you see a path that leads up
into a foothills region. Standing here on the boundary between light and
darkness, you feel very vulnerable and alone.

heard and little light penetrates the canopy of trees above you. The air here
smells musty and you long for a fresh breath. You see an intersection of paths
to the west. The path you are on leads south into the darkening woods.

The bloody intersection~
This is a small intersection. Paths lead east, west, and south. You are struck
by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were drug off in two directions,
south and east.

Before the huge tree~
You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes, is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is

life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills

stiff ocean wind has blown the rocks smooth here and you have to lean forward
a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are

The River, Styx~
   The treetops extend across the sky now,blocking the moonlight leaving
darkness...  An owl sits in a branch a few yards above,eyeing you closely.
Fear seems to overcome you now,as the owl stares into your soul,a gust of
cold wind engulfs the land.

the winter.  It's almost as if this land has'nt been touched for ages,no
footprints or markings anywhere and the wildlife is very abundant.

animals,birds chirping and the sort.  Yet no sound comes from the river...
Very strange.  For the first time you notice a dim,blue glow is

as the ones you have seen before.  Another alleyway leads to the
south, while Cthulus Way leads east and west.

   No sooner than you step into this alley,storm clouds roll in from all
directions and a massive thunderstorm begins to broil.  The cenery around
you seems to shift and change.  A streaking flash of lightning strikes and
you are left momentarily blinded!  When you open your eyes again a large
being stands above you poking the horn on his head in your torso!

stones stone circle~
The tall stones form a rough circle, and enough of them have lintels
bridging the tops of two uprights that is possible to imagine that all
the monoliths were once so capped. the hub of the circle is dominated
by a huge stone disc, deeply carved with symbols and runes and mounted
horizontally on carved representations of serpents. In the center of the
disc is a pinnacle topped by a crystal. Emanating from this crystal are 
two brilliant beams of light though the source of the illumination is 
not visible. The vivid shafts of sparkling light strike the rim of the 
disc at two distinct and separate points.

Entrance to Loring's Manor~
You enter upon a small room that is totally bare of furnishings, but in
the center of the room is a boulder. A human-like nose and mouth are
evident, and eyes as well, which are closed. The surface of the stone 
is translucent, and vague shapes can be seen, dimly and infrequently.
Once you are inside, the rock opens its eyes and, with a bemused
expression on its stone lips, it speaks. 
"You have done well to make it this far. I have but three simple
questions to ask, and if all are answered correctly, you will be
allowed to enter Loring's Manor. There is but one problem, if your
answer is incorrect you will be sent back to the Creek Crossing."

Instruction Room for Jail~
You must be of an editing level to set the duration of the room.
This is done by editing the teleport function of the room.
The formula is as follows.
edit tele <time> 3001 1
time is set as follows:
300 = 1 tick
the duration of the sentence doubles with the offense.
It starts at 4 ticks. Such that first offense is 4 ticks,
second eight, third sixteen, etc.
For a 3 offense the time would be: 16 * 300 = 4800
The fine a person gets is as follows:
        10% of gold carried and or in bank, depending on which
        you can tell.
        Take the best weapon the person has away from them.
        And you fine them a number of items equal to one less than
        the offense.
Example:
If this is a person's fourth offense they get fined as follows:
40% of their gold is taken (round up)
The person's best weapon is taken
The person looses their 3 best items.

  The ravine below drops away sharply into a mass of trees and scrub that have
grown so thick it seems to be choking on itself.  Mist curls through the
wilderness with an insistence that is unsettling, clinging to even the
uppermost reaches of the trees.  The ravine stretches away for perhaps a mile
on either side and a quarter of that distance to where the palace stands.
  There seems to be something else just beyond the mist hard to see. perhaps
you should look closer.
~

closer~
  As you take a closer look you see something just below the Federation
gate house which wards the Bridge of Sendic you see a scattering of huge stone
blocks just barely peeking out of the forest.  Can it be?  Is that the remains
of the Bridge of Sendic which was collapsed during the assault of the Warlock
Lord so many years ago?  And if it is,  that means the real People's Park is
down there.  And that means, the real Vault of the Shannarra is down there too!
Could the Sword of the Shannarra still be inside?  You can only hope.  What an
insidious propaganda campaign the Federation must have made to keep this a
secret!
~
E
palace~
  The palace looms just across the ravine.  All its doors and windows are
shuttered.  The stones of the palace are scared and dirty, and the whole of it
has the look of something that has not been in use for decades.  Yet ever
since the Federation took over the city they have occupied the Palace of the
Kings of Tyrsis but no one seems to know what they use it for.

Lord so many years ago?  And if it is,  that means the real People's Park is
down there.  And that means, the real Vault of the Shannara is down there too!

ravine pit~
  The ravine below drops away sharply into a mass of trees and scrub that have
grown so thick it seems to be choking on itself.  Mist curls through the
wilderness with an insistence that is unsettling, clinging to even the
uppermost reaches of the trees.  The ravine stretches away for perhaps a mile
on either side and a quarter of that distance to where the palace stands.
  There seems to be something else just beyond the mist hard to see. perhaps
you should look closer.

closer~
  As you take a closer look you see something just below the Federation
gate house which wards the Bridge of Sendic you see a scattering of huge stone
blocks just barely peeking out of the forest.  Can it be?  Is that the remains
of the Bridge of Sendic which was collapsed during the assault of the Warlock
Lord so many years ago?  And if it is,  that means the real People's Park is
down there.  And that means, the real Vault of the Shannara is down there too!
Could the Sword of the Shannara still be inside?  You can only hope.  What an
insidious propaganda campaign the Federation must have made to keep this a
secret!
~
E
palace~
  The palace looms just across the ravine.  All its doors and windows are
shuttered.  The stones of the palace are scared and dirty, and the whole of it

since the Federation took over the city they have occupied the Palace of the
Kings of Tyrsis but no one seems to know what they use it for.

arch is beautiful and great care has been taken placing the stones and
polishing them.  However, if it happens that the outer wall is breached, the

legendary Sword of Shannara which defeated the Warlock Lord so many years ago
has disappeared entirely.  Perhaps there is no hope left, only the Federation.

Sewers of Tyrsis~
  This is the sewer system of Tyrsis.  From history you know that the sewer is
an intricate construction that was used both as a sewer system, an underground
fortification, and a last ditch escape route.  It doesn't look like it has
been used in ages though.  The torches which line the tunnels are all but
burned away and some are quite moldy.  You hear the sounds of rats, bugs and
other creepy crawly things scurrying about just out of sight.

The Entrance To The Fjord~
   You stand at the edge of a huge gorge in the rock. When you look down, you
can see that the crystal clear waters of the ocean fill almost the entire base
of the gorge. Off in the distance you think you can see the faint outline of a
rainbow created by the ocean mist.
   There is a narrow trail here which leads down along the cliff wall which
leads to a small village beside the water.

The cliff wall is imposing on your right, and on your left you notice that
it is quite a drop to the water below. You are not feeling too comfortable in
this spot, but it is the only way to get to your destination.

   A feeling of doom rushes through your veins as you enter this room. You can

water from the fjord in. In the middle of the cave is a small island, and you
can see that there is a chest resting there. You know that the treasure of the
village must be in the chest, and you want it, but you do not know what might
be guarding it.

preoccupied with their duties right now than with fending off intruders.

faint outline of a huge arch against the mist of the ocean. You are able to
board the ship to the east . There is an old man standing here, dressed for
battle, but you can tell by the tears in his eyes he was not permitted to go.

expedition, and you have walked into the middle of the activity. There is a
large mast here, and on each side of the boat are rows of seats where the
vikings sit to row the boat. You can tell by the expressions on the men's
faces that they are not pleased to see you.

you could run you would like to, this is not the place to get caught in a cave
in.

Collapse!!!~
   This was the wrong choice! The walls keep on pressing in, and you are
slowly being crushed. You want to turn back, but you can hardly move. You are
running short of breath now, and everything is becoming dark. Slowly you feel
each piece of your equipment getting crushed, and then finally so are you.

The Very Small Tunnel~
   It looks like you have made the wrong decision in choosing to travel this
way. The tunnel is getting tighter now, but you can still move. You should
turn back now, or you might not be able to get out later! Better huury up and
move, there is no telling when the walls might collapse.

   You are sensing that a little more room has come back to your surroundings.
Guess it was not such a bad decision after all. You have no time to sit and
gloat about your choice now, this place could still come down. The tunnel
continues to the east.

You are pretty sure the exit is coming up, even though you can not see it.
This was the worst pathway for anyone to travel, but you are coming close to

around, you notice that the only other exit than the one you just came from is
blocked by bars. Upon closer inspection however you see that these bars are
old, and the sea air has corroded them.

been parted a little to form a little bit of an opening. While standing in
this spot, you can hear a low growling noise coming from the north. Also when
you look at the trees you see deep gashes made by claws. You are begining to

The Room Of The Goddess Frigga~
   There is a lot of plush and luxurious furniture in this room. All of it
seems to be arranged to comfort just one person. This is exactly what you 
would expect the room of a goddess to look like. There are many pictures 
in this room of the Goddess Frigga. It seems you have interrupted Frigga's 
meditation period with your entrance.

The Heroes Hall~
   You stand in a very large room with long tables that stretch the entire
length of the hall. When you look around the room, you notice that the walls
and roof are held up by 4 large spears in the corners, and these spears have
been polished to such a sheen that they provide light for the entire room. 
You see many Norse Heroes walking around the hall, and serving their every 
need are the Valkyrie who are scurrying around here. There are doors to your 
east and north.

   This room contains a lot of stange looking equipment that not too many
people use nowadays. The objects seem to have something to do with the
atmosphere and weather. Sitting at a desk in the corner, you see an old man
that looks like he has seen his share of battles, and this is the God Aegir,
working on some kind of water experiment.

the room practicing some combat maneuvers with a very large hammer.

man. On the walls are pictures of great battles between a young blonde haired
man and giants, as well as trophies of stuffed animal heads, claws, and teeth.
All of this shows that a great warrior sits upon the throne that is here.

area that seems to be used to store some animals. This seems to be the only
place since you came into the fjord below that has allowed the sun to penetrate
the mist. Looking at a patch of dirt near the wall, you see the tracks of what
looks like two horses traveling close together, and a couple of wolves. You
can see a small stable to the northeast.

clothes stained and reeking of curing hides.  The mansion is very large
and of course very pretentious.

Before Stonewall~
   You are on a flat stretch of dismal black rock littered with
boulders. Made of a strange dark stone that reflects silvery in the
sunlight, they tower above you, but you can make out a narrow path

sign~
The words painted on this sign are just barely discernable under the
thick layer of dirt that covers them. You can make out the warning :

  Beware ye oh inexperienced travelers, for ye shall feel the taste of
    my aggression! If ye value yer life venture far from this realm!
          --Morgwaith the King of the Vultures, ruler of Siralyr.

In the Crevice~
   You are pressed up between two very large black boulders. The hard
rock is icy cold against your back as you maneuver yourself through
the narrow space. If you wriggle around enough, you can squeeze
through the boulders to the north.

On the Wall~

Grabbing on to some jagged rocks, you carefully begin your ascent....

   You are on a near vertical stretch of the cold black stone wall.
There are several sharp pieces of rock jutting out from its sheer face
that can be used for hand and footholds.  The ground is not far below 
you, while above you the wall towers into the heavens.

hang by their nails, dangling over a rocky creek. The boards groan

to this wonderous room. At this moment it seems that the royal family is
preparing for another spectacular gala.  A Roadrunner Page passes you by,
on an errand for the King.

   You see before you the royal spectacle that is the King's throne room.
The walls, covered with many fabulous tapestries and shields bearing the
royal seal, strike wonder into the hearts of the many young nobles when they
enter the room for the first time. To your south you can see the throne of
the Great Eagle King.

Throne Room of the Great Eagle King~
   This part of the throne room is popular with the many royal courtiers
that frequent the Castle of Miralon. A large fireplace is in the wall here,
next to which is a low stool. You can hear the gentle tune being played by
the court musician, and hear the soft whispered words of gossip and intrigue
bandied about by the nobles.

Hall of Horror~
   By the low moans and mangled arms that reach out desperately through
the metal bars, you identify this horrible place as the holding area for
hundreds of failed polymorph experiments. Careful not to alert the rest of
the kingdom of their dark experiments and mishaps, the Black Mages of 
Miralon have hidden away all their failed spell subjects. Beings that
were once happy young citizens of the kingdom now rot in these horrid
cells, moaning in agony, unable to live in their spell warped bodies.

estimate that this castle's outer walls stretch at least 200 feet into 
the sky.  The ground here is real earth, not the strange cloud stuff of the
city, and it shakes beneath you from time to time as the giant inhabitants
of the castle go about their business.

enclosure you stand in is a thousand feet on a side.  No longer is the 
ground beneath you made of weird cloud-stuff, but of real earth, and it
trembles with the activities of giants around the fortress.

the barracks for the local guards.  A few smells reach you through the
doorway making you want to retch.  Cloud giants have terrible odors

   This is where the gods leave rewards for those brave and strong enough
to overcome the might of the furies.  Truly some battles are worth fighting
after all!

Antechamber for Gorn's Room~
   This chamber opens onto the great feast hall in the east and onto
the throne room of the king in the west.  A thick carpet covers the floor,
with scenes of great havoc that could well be Ragnarok itself. 
Torches line the wall at 10 foot intervals.

Throne Room of King Gorn~
   The hallway widens out here again into yet another monstrous hall.
A huge throne has been carved out of the western wall, and stout pillars
line the walk up to the throne.  Massive chandeliers hang every 15 feet 
or so from the ceiling, each one carrying at least 100 candles.

The Plains~
   You are travelling through some rolling plains, along a well traveled

The Lane~
   You are strolling along a pleasant, shady lane. The road is lined on both
sides by tall, stately trees which lend the scene with a sense of quiet
serenity. You can follow the road north or south.

The Crossroad~
    Four roads meet here, and a large signpost labels each of the.  To the
west, you can see the smoke and haze of a city.  To the north is a hilly
area, to the east, another hilly area that looks like it heads into the
mountains.  To the south, a road leads through some farmland and fields.

City Entrance~
   You stand on the outskirts of a large city, Sanctuary; the capital of this
land. The road leads east into the peace and quiet - and dangers - of the
forest; and to the west it becomes the main street of the town; surrounded by
a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.

The Southern End of a Road~
   This is the beginning of a road that stretches out north through
the plains.  It is very well built, and runs almost flat along the
plains.  To the south in the distance is a light forest, and to the
southeast you can make out the smoke of fires from a large encampment.

A Pleasant Road~
   You are travelling along a north-south stretch of a well built road.
Fitted stones make the road a pleasure to traverse.  Wide cleared areas to
either side of the highway make robbery or ambush seem unlikely.  The sounds
of a merchant caravan travelling somewhere nearby reach your ears,
and occasionally you spot worthless items, presumably discarded by
passing merchants seeking to lighten their load.

that not many people travel this way anymore.  To the north are the

The Beginning of the Great Road~
   A well made road runs off in the distance to the east here.  You wonder
what civilization could possibly have built such a magnificent highway.
Each stone has been laid with such care that no gaps even an inch across are
to be found between the cobbles.  Tightly packed gravel at the edges of the
road keeps grass and weeds from overrunning the stones.

The Great Road~
The Great Road leads both east and west here.  You get the sense that
the road is slowly sloping down to the east, but the terrain is basically
flat.  The vegetation is rather sparse, with the exception of a dark
grove of trees just to the north.  No light seems to penetrate their
boughs, and all is lost in shadow.

The Great Road Junction~
   A split in the road allows you the choice of three directions.  Forks
lead off to the north, east, and west.  The road to the east seems to run
through flat country, as does the western route.  The ground to the north,
however, seems steadily to climb up through increasingly rocky hills.  
Ancient engineers seem to have levelled a path for the road to take, though,
since the actual road is neither uneven nor steep.

rocks to the east.  The foliage appears healthier here, as if plenty of rain
falls on it.  Despite the damp conditions, the condition of the road does

The Coast~
   This is the eastern terminus of the Great Road, and the western shore 
of some enormous and ominous sea.  Where not far away, sun and light seemed
to be the norm, black skies and gusting winds dominate the weather here.
The coastline is composed of great rocks, dark in color, and with nasty sharp
edges.  This would not be a pleasant place to captain a ship in a storm.
The constant windy weather kicks up inhospitable waves on the sea which crash
resoundingly against the rocks.  The entire scene is exhilarating with its
natural power.

A small hut~
   This small, run-down hut gives the impression that it used to belong
to some farmer or gleaner who finally gave up on the poor yield of the
surrounding land.  No articles of furniture adorn the one-room dwelling,
and holes in the walls and roof allow you to enjoy outdoor weather, even 
indoors.  To the north, the Great Road is visible through the broken door-way.

many other varieties.  Some appear to have been chewed as though they were
legs of mutton, and some have merely been mutilated.  A sixth sense is

Stray beams of light pierce the dimness from above every few minutes, 
leading you to believe that you are near the upper limit of this cloud bank.

Above the Clouds~
   You are unclear as to whether you stand on a cloud, or on some very
high peak that is merely covered by cloudy mists.  The stairway below is
impossible to locate because of the fog, but a path leads along the top
of the clouds to the west.

A Cloudy Path~
   Curiously enough, the impression that you are standing atop actual
clouds does not seem to be fading.  Perhaps some freak of science allows
clouds to support weight in this strange land.  Warm sunlight is always on
your face, since there are never clouds above you.  The path
continues both to the east and west.

A Cloudy Path~
   Your cloudy path seems to be approaching an intersection.  Just to 
the west, you spy a fork in the walkway.  Distant sounds of hustle and 
bustle begin to reach your ears, leading you to suspect that you are also
nearing some sort of settlement.  A brisk wind whips your clothing
around you.

A Fork in the Cloudy Path~
   Three options are available to you in terms of direction of travel.
East and west forks of the path here seem to be relatively small and rarely
used branches, but immediately to your north is a magnificent gateway,
rising proudly up over he clouds.  You can see in the distance now many of
the people who were making the noises you detected-- errr the
giants who were making the noise that is.

Western Cloudy Path~
   Out here on the western portion of the path, the elements seem to be 
less in check.  A strong wind whips about you, chilling you to the bone
despite the constant bombardment by the sun's rays.  The incessant gusting
of the wind kicks up furls of mist and obscures to a degree the
path, which runs both east and west here.

Western Cloudy Path~
   The swirling mist of clouds makes it impossible to see any farther
than right in front of you, and you are frequently knocked to your knees
by frightful gusts of wind.  The light of the sun is scarcely visible due
to the pushing around of fogs by the breeze.  You think you can
just make out a trail that continues yet west and east.

End of Navigable Path~
   The rushing about of wind here has reached a fever pitch, and travel
any farther west seems suicidal.  It is nearly impossible to hear yourself
think, let alone anything else, due to the screaming torrents of misty wind.
A solid of some sort seems visible to the north, with an entryway carved 
out of it.  Perhaps respite from the weather can be found there.  The path
can be followed back east, but you think it would be a bad idea to take
it any farther west.

Home of Elmhorn the Cloud Mage~
   Sure enough, this small room seems to be carved out of a mountain
that protrudes above the clouds.  The winds outside are fierce, but they 
seem unable to affect you in here.  The walls are adorned with all manner
of interesting artifacts from strange lands far and near.  A desk in the
corner is littered with various manuscripts, and charred spots here and 
there on the floor lead you to suspect that more than a few magic 
experiments have been carried out in this chamber.

Gateway to Cloud City~
   This magnificent arch rises at least three dozen paces into the sky,
and is fashioned of stone blocks larger than any horse you have seen could 
pull.  The clouds underfoot from here north seem to take on a compressed
nature, as if some powerful magic forced them to imitate hardwood.  Only
once in a while do you see a stray wisp of cloudy matter refusing to lie
flat.  North through the gateway, you spy a city built on a huge scale:
Giant figures stroll the boulevards, taking steps longer than you are tall.

Inside the Gate~
   You now stand inside the Great Gate in the Clouds, and before you 
stretches out the city in the clouds.  A huge town square dominates the
scene immediately to the north, with busy cloud giants rushing about their
daily business.  The warm feel of sunshine on your face is a pleasure,
and the brisk air up here feels cleaner than any other you have breathed.

the benches and doorways are scaled to a size that far exceeds yours, so
you find yourself constantly craning your neck upwards.  You keep half
expecting the ground to shake every time a giant walks anywhere, but this
cloud-ground seems surprisingly firm.

the north.  Not far to the south is the Great Gate.

fountain is south.  The magnificent fortress of Gorn, king of the cloud
giants, is visible well to the north.  With no grass of any kind growing
here, you wonder what these people find to eat... humans, maybe?

elsewhere.  Just south of here is the town square, and snobby giantshops
have their wares for sale to the east and west.

of well-to-do giants.

High overhead, pennons in the black and gold of Gorn flutter in the breeze.
A monstrous drawbridge leads north into the castle, and it looks to be
at least 4 feet thick; you would give roughly a 0% chance for a ram ever
to smash through it.

city.  Simple but large dwellings stand both north and south of here.

and to the south is the Cloud City Meat Shoppe.

a cloud above you to mar the view.  Just north of you is the entrance to 
a humble, yet immense home.  South of here is the Grog Stand.

The plush carpeting under your feet is a nice change from the rugged paths
you are used to travelling. A chrome stairway spirals downstairs to the
tavern of the Dancing Daemon Inn, and your future adventures in New Thalos.

The Dancing Daemon Inn~
A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon. An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
all are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.  The only obvious exit is to the north.

seeking revenge for their deaths at the hands of Adventurers like you. The
first great Chieftain of the Aucan tribe is buried somewhere in these Sacred
Grounds, it has been said that he buried the secret to a great Aucan treasure

You may exit via the one-way door, south.  DONT expect to

very large room.  At the very back of the room is a man, at least it looks
like a man.  He is glowing with mystical energy and seems intent upon
watching some ninjas attacking each other.  There seems to be some kind
of tournament going on.  No one notices you, because they are all watching
the competition.

You are in the gigantic room.  All manner of weapons line the walls.
The ceiling has a large face of an oriental demon painted on it.  There are
about 30 warriors in the room.  Along the back wall are 5 large thrones.
Three men and two women sit in these chairs.  You get a very bad feeling
about this entire situation.  Beside the largest throne is a pedastal.
On the pedestal is the object of your mission...the WuTan chalice!

is the throne of Tung Mai. He is wanted in Sanctuary for the assassination
of Zifnab.  Bringing him to justice would bring respect to your guild.
The lands of Sanctuary have been in turmoil of late, and Tung's trial would
do much to promote the force of good in the lands!

the mastermind behind the theft of the WuTan chalice from the buddhist
temple to the north.  He is a demi-god!!  And as such enjoys all the
power and priviledge of his status.  The chalice is sitting on a pedestal
next to the avatar.  MAN YOU HAVE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU!!!!

everything is quiet. You wonder if the evil jailer has run out of victims
for his torture sessions.

 This small cell is occupied by a small very very old man. As you walk in
he looks up at you and smiles and the hope of rescue enters his eyes.
Then the light in his eyes slowly dims and he hunches over. The rats are

Jailer's private chamber is to the east and cells are to the North and

in braziers in the four corners of the room shedding an evil light

the south wall. After two to three drops you already fell agitated and 
very nervous. In the center of the room sittin on a chair made of
human bones sits the Mongol Jailer. He glows with an eerie light.
He throws back his head and cackles with glee as you enter. Suddenly,
he gets up, drawing a great sword in one fluid motion, and leaps to

clay and stone is all the view has to offer. Most of these homes are 
nothing but piles of rubble, but some look almost safe enough to venture
into. The street continues north and south and buildings line the

Harbor~
  You step off the pier and into the main harbor. Unbelievably, it's even
more crowded than the Pier as workers rush about moving goods from 
warehouses to the ships and to the market. Warehouses and docks stretch
all the way from the east to the west, as far as you can see. 
To the north, you see the town square.

get on your feet.  Looking up, you can see that the storm has become fully
developed.  Rain has begun to pour down from the darkened heavens.  The
Island is bigger than it looked from below.  A large rain forest is what
it looks like, many tropical plants can be seen, to the north, from your
position.  The temperature is remarkably warm for a rain storm also.  To
the east, you can see what looks like a worn path in the ground.  It heads
off into the forest.

Long Hallway~
   This hallway stretches as far as the eye can see, it seems almost
unreal.  Torches align the walls, lit with an eerie green flame.
Beholders can be seen hovering back and forth, throughout the hallways.
Thats odd, you once heard that beholders could not live with other
beholders because they were so intolerant of themselves.

Long Hallway~
   The end of the hallway can be seen from here.  Beholders are becoming
more frequent now, trying to defend their palace from intruders.  More and
more begin to appear to ward you off.  You have noticed though, the 
discrimination between the beholders.  Some are attacking you, while 
others totally ignore you, and continue on past you, working on parts of
the palace.

Dammaged Room~
   You stand in a room of the castle that is still being put together.  It
looks as if this palace was under attack by something large not that long
ago..  Rain water seeps in from the walls as Lensmen work to finish
repairing this room.  Materials are brought into the room by other
Lensmen, and set down, for the working ones.  You see a few warrior
beholders guarding the entrance of the room, making certain the workers do
not stop, or face being devoured.

To the west, you think you can see what looks to be an old treasure room,

stone door, hiding its belongings within.

You stand at the base of a mighty set of stone stairs.  They lead upwards
toward a small entrance in the side of the mountain, surrounded by several
of the dwarven guards.  You wonder if this is the entrance to their mountain.

The Entrance~
You stand before the doors leading to the Dwarven Kingdom of Mal Ador.  Inside
the ringing of metal against metal and stone reverberates.  The gates are
sealed shut, however, and don't look like they will be opened any time soon.

Outside Camelot~
  The King's Road has its western terminus here just north of a glorious
castle.  High, unbreached walls of granite and majestic towers of gold
characterize this imposing fortress, which can only be the legendary
Camelot.  A stout drawbridge, down at the moment, offers entrance to the
gate house, where you see occasional flashes of Arthur's white and
gold liveried guards.

The Gatehouse~
  This solid stone building meets all visitors as they arrive and
depart noble Camelot.  A great iron portcullis is suspended overhead,
ready to drop and deny ingress to the enemies of the king, but surely
no-one would desire as an enemy the good king, Arthur!

south of here, as well as to the gate house to the north.  A door to the
east leads to the training yard where young squires train for years to
become knights.  The sun's rays are brilliantly reflected by banners of
all colors hanging from the high walls on all sides.

up as high as well.  A great round table of solid oak dominates the
chamber, and looks as if it could seat well over a hundred men.  The
tempting smells of a fine meal in preparation waft in from the west.
You could almost swear that you hear praying through the door to the east.
The hallway continues both to the north and south.

tastes.  He has his room furnished only with the basics, and no
mosaics, hangings or rugs are in evidence.  A large window in the
southern wall offers a beautiful view of the queen's garden.
Launcelot is sitting in a sturdy chair by the window.
Despite the far-away look on his face, you feel pretty sure
that this man has never lost a fight and probably never will.

Room of Despair~
  This room is well named, for you discover upon entering that it has no
exits!  Looks like time to break out the old scroll of recall-- I
hope you brought one with you.

Patrol Post~
  The dutiful Antipaladin Patrol is based here, and takes its job very 
seriously.  They will exterminate any outsider they lay eyes on, including
YOU!  Pictures cover the walls, with subject matter ranging from grizzly
deaths to prolonged and painful torture.

A Green Meadow~
  You stand in a grassy meadow with annoyingly cute dandelions growing
here and there.  You hear the merry bubbling of a brook somewhere ahead,
and to the north you see a narrow wooden bridge.  The scents of perpetual
spring either delight or disgust you, depending on whether you go
for the trite stuff like this.  On the bridge to the north you see an
ebony-clad figure.  He looks pretty tough, so you better try to get by
him fast!

The Black Knight's Bridge~
  A quaint little bridge over the pleasant stream.  To the south is a
green field and to the north is the southern terminus of the King's Road.
The scene would be utterly charming if this were not the bridge
frequented by the infamous black knight.  He just doesn't know when
to quit, does he?

The King's Road~
   The King's Road is the kind of road that merchants love: well used
and well patrolled by the local authorities to keep thieves away.
Here it runs from north to south.  To the east is a magnificent
building beyond an arched entryway.  The place emanates goodness.

  The King's Road bends here from west to south.  The terrain is
mountainous and stately pine trees rise up to either side of the road.
There seems to be no directions open to travel other than along the road.

The King's Road~
  The road winds its way from east to west as it cuts between the
peaks of the Gwynned Mountains.  Some cheerful traders wave happily as
they pass you headed in the opposite direction.  They seem to feel
protected as they travel the King's Road.  A path leads up the side of
the hill north of the road, and it appears to be wide enough to allow
humanoid traffic.

Aboard Ship~

Sailors are unloading expensive piles of furs, while others are
loading up sundry items and foodstuffs for its next voyage.  The
captain gives a shout, and the crew makes ready to sail once again...

The Wide Ocean~
    The ship on which you journey travels for endless days upon the
open sea.  Occasionally you spot small specks on the horizon, tiny
unexplored islands, small stretches of sand on an infinite blue plane.
The heat swelters as, after long days, you cross the equator, and head
into the uncharted waters of the southern hemisphere...

    The waters get a little rough, and the temperature suddenly drops
drastically.  Off in the disance you notice large clumps of ice floating
about, some as large as small hills!  Far to the south, you can make
out the thin line of land, and dark clouds seem to be massed over it.

The Shores of The Cold Land~
    Rising up before you is a large land mass, most definitely the bleak
continent of The Cold Land.  You are approaching a wide bay, but as you
draw nearer snow begins to fall from the sky, coating everything in a
white frost.  You pull your cloak tight around you, but it does little 
to keep out the cold.  The captain of the ship expertly maneuvers the
vessel around shifting icebergs, and you are sure that without his expertise,
your journey would surely fail.

Ice Haven~
    Miraculously, the captain has managed to guide the ship to a small
beacon of light at the end of the bay.  From what you have heard, this
is the town of Ice Haven.  The wind has picked up drastically, and you
are nearly blinded by the blizzard-like conditions.  You wonder how
anyone could ever choose to live in such harsh conditions.

has for the most part gone ashore to Ice Haven, seeking revels and good
fun in the warm interiors of the sparsely inhabited town.  To the nort
the ship makes ready for its return to Sanctuary, while to the south
lie the docks of Ice Haven.

Underneath the Dock~
    Directly underneath the dock, and pushed up against the shoreline, a small
overhang of rocks drop off into the ocean.  Centered on the underbellow of the
dock, two old men have cast their fishing poles into the water.  The men are
dressed in heavy furs, and judging from the heavy coat of frost hanging off
their furs, it would appear they have been here for quite some time.

Frozen ice threatens your steady footing, and you have to occasionally
grab a nearby rope to catch your balance.  A fall into the water here
would almost certainly send you into hypothermia and a slow freezing
death.  A small bay surrounded by glaciers and speckled with floating
icebergs stretches out to the north.  A few ships are docked here, but
their crews don't seem to be in a rush to go anywhere.

around the world from the place you call home.  Ice and snow clings to
the wooden pilings, and a mist of fine snow falls from the sky, coating
your equipment with a white frosting.  Directly to the north is a large
vessel, making ready to depart for warmer climes.  The dock creaks and
moans as you walk across it.  There are some planks here that appear to
be lifting up from age.

as a guard tower, warning the dwellers of Ice Haven of any coming dangers.
You doubt it would be very effective, though, for the swirling snow seems
neverending, and most likely any invading force would not even be able
to find the town in the white haze.  There is a trapdoor in the ceiling
to get to the roof, but it has long since been frozen shut.

of the snow is kept from dropping down directly onto the street.  However
it doesn't do anything for the cold wind blowing off the ocean.  To the
west a guard tower just breaks the top of the wall, and a faint light
from the tower's window shows that a guard is presently on duty.  To the 
east the sound of the ocean can be heard pushing up against the docks.  
There are also signs of merchant stores further down the street.  To the south
there is another guard tower, and judging from the distant light, another main 
street.

Still, only the brave - or foolhardy - dare journey into the snowy wastes

Before Grundil's Keep~
    Standing even taller than the walls that hold it up, the mansion's 
gate is almost as thick has a grown man is wide.  Closer inspection of 
the gate shows that it appears to be more funtional for keeping people 
in, then it is for keeping them out.  At the top of the gate, barbed 
spikes face inwards, rather then outwards to prevent intruders from leaving.

The Ground Floor~
    The instant you step over the threshold you are nearly overcome by the
sudden change of temperature.  In stark contrast to the cold, billowing snow
outside, this room and the others around it, have been heated to a much
warmer temperature, almost too hot.  The place is well lit by a glowing
fireplace, and you can't help but be amazed at the wealthy trappings which
decorate the room.  There are more rooms off to the north, south, and east.

The Trophy Room~
    This is a large, comfortable room on the ground floor of the tower.
Another fireplace burns brightly here, and beautiful carpets and tapestries
decorate the room.  On the mantle are mounted many game trophies, a large
moose head, a polar bear, something hideous and unrecognizable, and many
others.

A Study~
    Shelves of books line the walls, and some comfortable chairs lie
scattered about the room.  Torches burn in wall sconces, lighting up
a large map on one wall.  Judging from the amount of chairs around
the map, it might require further investigation.  The warmth of this
room makes it hard for you to believe that just outside the tower the
snow falls incessantly.  To the east is a large room, and there is a
trapdoor on the ceiling, which you can reach by pulling down a ladder.

    This is a large, cozy room within the tower.  A set of expensive-
looking couches are spread out, and a large white fur carpet lines the
floor.  There are three rooms to the east, south, and west, and another
smaller room to the north.

Grundil's Bedroom~
    The sheer lavishness of these quarters amazes you.  It is difficult
to fathom how such fineries could ever have come to be on this forsaken
continent.  A large bed is the centerpiece of the room, and it is
accompanied by a large chest, a small desk, and several chairs.  Centered 
on the desk is a thick book that looks like a diary.  A closet is to the
east, and a trapdoor in the floor leads down a ladder.

diary~
    Opening the book up, you flip to a random page, "The 1st Day of the 
Month of the Ancient Darkness, Year 200 - Court Trials: The Court mage
was caught supplying the local rabel with free healing.  I can't let
the peasants think that I gone soft.  I'll just have to make an
example out of him *Sigh* What a pity, he did save my life when I was
just a baby.  Oh well, can't let personal feeling get in the way of
profit.
    The 2nd Day of the Month of the Ancient Darkness, Year 200: The trial
was quick and painless.  After some bribes to the magistrate it was a
simple  matter of getting the right people together to hang him.  The
hangman is outside as we speak setting up the gallows for the execution,
which will take place tomarrow.
    The 3rd Day of the Month of the Ancient Darkness, Year 200: The mage
has barricaded himself in the dungeon with magical wards.  From what I can
gather it looks like dragon magic.  He can't stay in there forever,
so he'll die of hunger, thirst, or the noose.  Either way he will be
dead for his treason.
    The 5th Day of the Month of the Ancient Darkness, Year 200: That fool!
He has ruined us all!  The mage has put a curse on all of Ice Haven.
The waters are now infested with huge sheets of ice, and the entire land
around my town is nothing but a frozen Tundra.  Now I will never get out
of this forsaken land.  Who in their right mind would ever want to come
and replace me.  I will make him pay through the pain and suffering of
the towns folk.  I will increase taxes and reduce any outside help.  He
should be able to hear their death cries from his dungeon cell.  I'll have
to commission a locksmith to make a padlock for the dungeon door in the
cellar.  The mage well pay dearly for crossing me.

A Closet~
    This closet is quite small, but it is filled to capacity with fine
rainments.  Interspersed with thick, warm clothes, you also find some
items that seem more suited for warmer climes.  Although the heat in
this tower itself is practically unbearable.

scent of some large animal roasting inside.  Pots and pans hang from hooks,
and a sink and large carving table is against one wall.  There is also a
dumb waiter against the south wall, for use in carrying food to the next
floor.  An exit is to the north, and you spot a trapdoor in the floor, with
a flight of stone steps leading down.

freeze into icicles before they even reach the ground.  There are several
boxes and crates stacked here, mostly basic stores in case of seige.  On
the south wall is a heavy door with a huge steel lock.

    Much like the rest of the dungeon, this cell is covered with centuries 
of dust and mold.  However, this cell seems to have had some rescent use.  
Laying on the ground is a half rotten corpse of an elf.  The corpse appears 
to have had his skin flayed off its body so bady you can't tell the gender 
of the victim, however it's a lucky guess that the corpse was female.
Stuck into the neck of the elf is a palm sized blade.

    Sitting in a chair in the center of the room, a lich in a mage's
robe stares blankly at a obsidian door on the east wall, as if in a
trance.  His eyes glow a bright light blue, his skin is charred black
as if he was set on fire, and a set of gold rings and a heavy silver
necklace adorn his body.  His legs are chained to the floor with what
appears to be some sort of ivory colored animal hair.  What ever the
Lich's purpose here is, it appears he has been here for a very long
time.  On the far wall is yet another obsidian door, but this one has
a glowing red symbol of Grundil's Coat of Arms.

Next to the bed is a small table that has a picture of a incredibly
young and beautiful lady.  She is wearing an emaculate pearl and silver
dress, and has a glowing gold crown upon her head.  Written in ink
across the frame are the words, "To my dearest love, Electra, I am so
sorry."  Underneath the desk is a small chest.

antarctic continent of The Cold Land.  To the south the land spreads
out into the white plains of drifting snow and shifting ice.  Far to

Start of a Brick Path~
   The air becomes cooler and more full of life as you step onto the 
beginning of a stone pathway, heading towards the town.  Off to the north,
you can see the edge of the town, a large, brick, town wall.  It looks as
if even the strongest sand storms couldn't cause it any harm.

smaller than the enormouse one to the north.  The one with dark clouds
surrounding it.A cold wind goes by you, and you feel the presence of evil

The mist of the Darken Wood is gone.  All around you, is wasteland.
Looking up, you see no trace of the cliff that you fell from.  All around,
the terrain is flat and travels long.  Something strange is going on here.
To the east, you see the entrance to the large Tower you saw and heard
about.  Trying to go west,north,or south, you find yourself bumping into an 'invisible' or 'fake' wall.
There is nothing there that you can see.  But there is some force blocking
you from going in that direction...

it near the top, occasionally lightning strikes from them.  This is the
tower.  The biggest one in the land.  Evil radiates from it like heat from
the sun.  There is no turning back.  The large, bone doors of the tower,
suddenly make a *CREAK*,then begin to open for you.Evil voices echo from
within,beckoning you to enter of the tower.

   This part of the forest lies at the base of the western side of the
strange mountain.The side is far too steep for you to climb,so the
sounds of 'kupo' must be coming from inside the mountain.Problem is..

Astral Plane~
   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you is greyness. The bleak landscape reaches farther than 
the eye can see, and farther than you will ever travel.  Occasionally, a 
globular bit of water, small mass of flame, or clod of earth is seen
floating by.  More importantly, however, are the various hued
pools of color you occasionally glimpse.  For by ENTERing these you 
will be able to leave this infinite nothingness.

A fortress, in the distance~
   To the west lies a drawbridge.  The fortress across the bridge
seems to be secured on a rather large base of rock.  A land mass
that size is rather odd for this plane.  Could it be a magical
construct?  Surely, whatever dwells in the castle, is a native to
this most desolate of worlds.

the eye can see, and farther than you will ever travel.  Occassionally, a 
globular bit of water, small mass of flame, or clod of earth is seen
floating by.  More importantly, however, are the various hued
pools of color you occassionally glimpse.  For by ENTERing these you 
will be able to leave this infinite nothingness.

An enormous pyramid, in the distance~
   A pyramid rises from the dreary landscape to the south.  It appears
to be floating?!?  Could this be the same structure, rumored to exist
in the great desert near New Thalos?  The pyramid is a magnificent
building set against the desolation of this alien background.  Maybe
the pyramid has an exit back to the Prime Material Plane?

A huge tree is in the distance~
   To the east you see a tree trunk.  A tree trunk?!?  Here?  Not
just any tree trunk, this trunk is wider than you can see off into
the distance!!  The trunk ascends into the heavens and descends into
a mist below.  Could this be the Norse tree of life?  There appear
to be a few branches, which look like they could support you.

Astral Plane~
   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you is greyness. The bleak landscape reaches farther than 
the eye can see, and farther than you will ever travel.  Occassionally, a 
globular bit of water, small mass of flame, or clod of earth is seen
floating by.  More importantly, however, are the various hued
pools of color you occassionally glimpse.  For by ENTERing these you 
will be able to leave this infinite nothingness.

A fraying~
The pure chaos of the astral plane seems to fray here, and in an odd way you
feel the chaos begin to ebb as it is followed by a nothingness.

A series of small hills, lie in the distance~
   To the east, a group of rocky land masses are grouped together.
The appearance is almost that of a group of hills.  Maybe there you
can find refugee from the emotion draining surroundings you currently
stand in.

Standing pool~
   A still, silvery body of fluid lies before you.  Hey!?!  Where is
exit to this area?  Damn, you must have stepped through a one-way door.
Trying not to panic, you think of a spell that may help you out of this
situation.  Maybe LOOKing into the pool will provide you with some
answers.  Hmmmm, you wonder if you can ENTER this pool?

Standing pool~
   A still, silvery body of fluid lies before you.  Hey!?!  Where is
exit to this area?  Damn, you must have stepped through a one-way door.
Trying not to panic, you think of a spell that may help you out of this
situation.  Maybe LOOKing into the pool will provide you with some
answers.  Hmmmm, you wonder if you can ENTER this pool?

Jarl.  Two enormous chairs sit in the center of this room.  Each chair
is adorned with the skull of a large dragon.  Huge, gaudy tapestries line

Several frozen carcasses line the walls, and a giant mortar and pestle, and
a giant ice-pick rest on a huge stone table.  Apparently, the giants freeze their food, and then use the ice pick to break the victim up into bite sized chunks, or use the mortar and pestle to grind the victim up into a
thick soup-like mixture, which they dunk pieces of ice into, like a dip.

the pleasant feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen
door.

Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier hanging down from

out streams of smoke from the north end of the bay, and hear the faint
sound of distant voices.  Most inspiring, though, is the top of a huge
marble statue atop one of the cliffs which peeks out over the trees.  This
is the north side of the bay, also, and apparently a matching structure
adorns the south cliff, too.  More buildings can be made out to the south,
but the cliffs rise too high there, so to the north you can steer to a
more promising place to drop anchor.

take a deep breath of the fresh jungle air and glance around at your sur-
roundings.  Several other small vessels are beached here, and many people
move about, paying you little heed.  They represent a menagerie of different
races and cultures, some unrecognizable, although most wear a rather roguish
countenance.  All except one group, that is.  An albino, pale skinned bunch
who seem quite peaceful.  While the others are engaged with unloading cargo
and ship transactions, the albino natives are simply casting out their nets
for fish.  To the north is a clearing in the jungle.

Many people, some apparently traders, adventurers, or more seedy-looking
characters, move about helter-skelter, except for the few albino-skinned folk,
who seem to move in a world of their own.  Judging by their primitive dress,
they must be native here.  The rest are a motley crew, and you notice one
group off to the side, who seem to be paying a little too much attention to
your equipment.
    Small makeshift buildings have recently been built, and tents are scattered
about.  As the group begins to approach, you think it might be wise to make
yourself scarce.

to the west is a sheltered spring. Directly to the east is a makeshift tent,
with a bright banner proclaiming "New Vortheld Tavern and Inn."  Adjacent
to this, workers are hammering together what appears to be the beginnings
of a more permanent structure. A poster has been tacked up to a partly
constructed wall.

Haakon's Sundries~
    This tent is a study in disarray.  Half-empty boxes and crates
are scattered about, and in the middle of the chaos is a fairly
disorganized-looking fellow, who is making a futile attempt to
create order.  Noticing your presence, he quickly stands up, and
offers his services.  "How may I help you, fortune seekers?"
A sign is on the counter.

Shady Sark's Office~
    Sark is the self-proclaimed leader of the black market in this
newly growing colony.  Fine objects 'd art are neatly stacked away
on shelves and in boxes, and as you ponder his wealth you notice
him eyeing your possessions greedily.  Maybe he'll give you a good
price for them.

Path Into the Jungle~
    The cleared area to the south has given way to jungle here, and
although you travel a broad path, you still feel a little claustro-
phobic, as the jungle forms an impenetrable barrier to your right
and left.  The odd chirping of birds and rustlings in the undergrowth
remind you that this greenery, foreboding as it may seem, is inhabited
by countless creatures.  You feel no danger, though, and are confident
as you continue.

New Vortheld Tavern~
    The interior of this tent has been made to look and feel as cozy as
it can be, given the current conditions.  The patrons don't seem to mind,
however, for the barkeep serves a fine ale.  Most of the customers
look downtrodden, for they came to this new land in search of wealth
but have so far come up empty handed.  Some are rumoring that the small
village to the northwest is hiding yet undiscovered riches.  By  the
appearance of the natives this appears unlikely, though, but you
have a gut feeling that treasure is still here to be had - somewhere.

A Broad Path Through the Jungle~
    This broad east-west path seems to get plenty of use.  Many signs
of foot travel are evident going in both directions.  On your second
glance, though, you see something you might have missed if you were not
more careful.  Just off the path, to the north, is a small hut nestled
in the dark shadows of the jungle.  Above its doorway are inscribed
magical wards of protection.

    Coming around the side of a rise, you discover that you are scaling
one of the cliffs that was visible from the ocean.  Indeed, the salty
sweet smell of the sea is present, and the roar of the waves becomes
audible.  To the south you can climb the cliff.  West leads back into
the jungle.

Around the Edge of a Cliff~
    You are skirting the edge of a cliff along a three-foot wide ledge.
Far below you the ocean crashes upon jagged rocks.  Seagulls  flying
overhead cavort happily with multi-colored tropical birds, but you are
really too busy trying to keep your balance to notice.  Up to the south
is the top of the cliff, and north leads down.

Top Of the Cliff~
    From here the view is breathtaking!  Far below you is the bay you
dropped anchor in, and from here the various boats are nothing but specs
upon the water.  To the east the ocean shimmers in the distance, and
its flat horizon seems to spread to the ends of the world.  To the north
the jungle extends for miles along the coast, a carpet of green.  Northwest
smoke from small blazes burn in the native village, and many miles off you
can see mountain peaks rising.  A river to the west winds inland, but what
catches your eye are two things:  Apparently there are ruins of a jungle-
covered city to the south of the bay, and you can also not help but notice
that a statue at least one hundred feet tall rises not more than twenty
feet away!  West is the statue, north leads down from the cliff.

    Rising up from the cliff is a huge sculpted statue, depicting a
cross between a man and a lion.  The lion's body is massively

The creature is supported by it's powerful hind legs, and boasts two
human arms, one wielding a powerful blade, the other holding open a
great tome.  The entire statue rests upon a marble pedestal, upon
which words are engraved in an ancient tongue.

residents milling about, smiling as they go.  In contrast to the dark
character of the makeshift camp near the shore, this firmly established
village feels safe, and you go forth unfettered.

Village Square~
    This village is the home of the peace-loving natives who style
themselves the "New Vortheldese".  This placid central square is rimmed by
small thatch-roofed huts, although a large building that lies to the north
is flanked by two modest-sized clay dwellings.  Villagers pass by, smiling
as you watch, and a cloud of peace descends.  These people are truly
innocents, and to bring them harm would be an evil act, indeed.

this place is as near to utopia as you have ever seen.

great tome.  The entire statue rests upon a marble pedestal, upon
which words are engraved in an ancient tongue.

An Old Archway~
    Jungle vines wrap around old stonework which stretches into a curved
archway overhanging the road.  Obviously this was a grand gateway in
ages past, but now the undergrowth has taken over.  Still, a feeling
of peacefulness fills your body as you pass through, and you feel certain
that no evil lives in this area, although whatever does exist might not
take kindly to fortune-seekers.  The road rises to the top of a low tell
just to the south.

The Ruins of Old Vortheld~
    Climbing the top of the tell, you are barely able to hold back a cry
of amazement at the majestic sight before you.  You stand at the north
end atop a low tell which extends a half-mile or so east to west and half
that distance north to south.  Ancient buildings, overgrown by the jungle
lie in the edges, surrounding a rectangular pool of clear water,
glistening a bright glow.  The most elaborate structure is on the
western end, and a long bridge spans the water to the south.

pool to the south, while a good-sized building lies to the north.  It's

for the centuries of jungle growth which has slowly taken over.

inlaid with carvings depicting many strange creatures and designs.  From

tell, surrounding the pool of water.  The large building to the west

Inside a Large Building~
    You have ascended the great marble steps, and passed through a row of
tall pillars, and now stand in the interior of what was once a great seat
of government.  Lofty walls rise on all sides, and meet at a wide, domed
ceiling, fifty feet up.  Most of the area is bare, except for some tatters
of old tapestries and a profusion of jungle growth through cracks in the
floor and walls.  Adjacent rooms lie to the east, west, and south.

The Fountain~
    Here, where the avenue crosses in front of a large building to the west,
an effluent stream of water still flows from an intricately carved fountain
at the edge of the pool, after who knows how many years.  Apparently
someone has kept this specific area relatively free of jungle growth, and
in working order, unlike most of the rest of the avenue along the top of
the tell.  The large building to the west, almost temple-like in appearance,
beckons your curiosity.

the rest of the area.  Directly to the west, and up the steps, the building
awaits, square in shape and surrounded by tall columns of white rock.
A golden dome at its top sparkles with sunlight.

of this great, central chamber are decorated with depictions of majestic,
otherworldly locales, and thrilling battles of dark and light magik.  A
massive dome hish above your head provides the canvass for a painting of
a massive tome, gilded with gold and adorned with unrecognizable inscriptions.

knowledge to the masses.  The statue has been kept in a good state over

patterns and flashes, making everything look almost ethereal.  A large
dais rises up at the end of the chamber, upon which rests a gleaming tome,
shining with a light deeper than the core of the sun.  It was not made
by mortal hands, of that you are certain.  Who knows what knowledge lies
within its gilded covers.

There is not much room in here, and it is quite cramped.  The space, too is
quite bare and uninteresting, except for the floor, that is.  The surface
you stand on looks to be nothing more than a misty fog!  Although the walls
and ceiling are of hard stone, the floor is kind of soft and spongy.  It's
almost as if it is trying to absorb your being.  You feel a slight pull,
do you dare enter this swirling mist?

consider that it may be a living organism, for you get a sense that it
is protecting you somehow.  You feel like your body is slowly moving
through it, although in which direction it is impossible to tell.  Perhaps
you will be free of it soon.

then suddenly becomes as dark as night.  At other times you see bright colors
twist, billowing hues splashing in and out of the mist.  The floor here is
solid, but your head brushes up against the wet spongy substance.  It is
quiet, but at the same time you hear sounds echoing in the distance...
    Steel ringing against steel, droning chants, muffled footsteps...
And the occasional blood-curdling scream.

A Swirling Mist~
    Swirling mist surrounds you.  The vapor is sometimes blindingly bright,
then suddenly becomes as dark as night.  At other times you see bright colors
twist, billowing hues splashing in and out of the mist.  The floor here is
solid, but your head brushes up against the wet spongy substance.  It is
quiet, but at the same time you hear sounds echoing in the distance...
    ...stealthy shadows, shadows forming, deep within the mist contorting...

through it, although in which direction it is impossible to tell.  Perhaps
you will be free of it soon.

The Shewaw River~
    You are floating on the Shewaw River.  Dense jungle lines the banks,
and you hear the calls of wild animals all around.  Bright tropical
fish swim underneath.  It is rather peaceful along this stretch.

be the remains of a small dock on the north bank.  Perhaps you should get
off and investigate.

On the Bank of the Shewaw River~
    You have interrupted your river journey at this old ruin of a dock.
It looks like no one has been here for years, and you can see no reason
for placing a landing spot here in the first place.  Just to the east,
however, you think you see something metal shining through the foliage.

The Shewaw River~
    You can't help but notice the difference in the atmosphere here compared
to what it was downriver.  The peaceful-seeming jungle has sudenly become
threatening.  The water has turned a murky brown, and you do not feel at
all comfortable.  It might be best to keep a wary watch.

The Artifact~
    Brushing aside the overgrown jungle, you uncover a strange looking
object.  It is a shiny metal obelisk, about ten feet tall.  There are no
markings on it's flawlessly polished surface, but you think you can
detect a faint humming from within.  This is very odd...

slithering sounds can be heard, and bubbles pop up to the surface of the
murky water.  The river bends to the east and north here, and you think
it would be best to continue moving.

The River Splits~

jungle has receded a little, and it is fairly easy to navigate.  The river
branching in from the east winds further inland.  The Shewaw, too, heads
off into the jungles to the north.

probably the remains of an old dock.  The Shewaw river runs just to the
east, and a low bank provides access to the shore to the west.  From here
you can see a pole of some kind stuck into the ground there.  You also
notice some small bubbles rising to the surface of the water.

The Top of the Temple of Shewaw~

you above the treeline, and you get a clear view of the green carpet
of the jungle.  A river winds a northwest to northeast path just to the
east of here.  Upriver a few miles away you can make out the smoke of
a village.  From downriver comes the salty smell of the sea.  At your
particular point, however, you have come to small edifice at the top of
the pyramid.  Primitive etchings are carved into the stone, and a deep
hole lies in the center, leading down into the pyramid.  A sturdy rope
will allow access in that direction.

Descent Into the Temple~

below.  It is too dark to see far in that direction, however.  Up above
you see daylight, while directly beneath you is a ledge that you should
be able to descend to.

this demented temple.  You still can't see the water far below, but you
can now hear it, and it sounds like it's flowing, although somewhat
slowly.  Directly above you are four ledges around the edges of the
shaft.  You think you see humanoid forms there looking down at you,
but you can't be sure.  Beyond that, daylight shines down through a
small hole.  The rope dangles further downward...

water.

know how far down the water is, or what you will find there.  As you
ponder your next course of action, you notice that you have grabbed
hold of some green slime on the rope.  It doesn't make for a good
gripping surface, and you notice your hands slowly sliding down...

SPLASH!!!!~
    You lost your grip on the rope above, and after a few seconds, hit the
water with a tremendous splash.  The water is slowly flowing to the east,
but enters a water-filled tunnel, so there's no way you could go in that
direction without magical means.  Above, too, it is too dark to see the
rope, but you know it is too far to reach without being able to fly.  Right
now, though, you have a more pressing matter to attend to.  You do not
seem to be alone in the water!

Blackened Field~

debris. A toxic gas seems to roll across this area in a constant flow
making you feel like you are choking or have something in your throat.
This area is quite a contrast from the lush grove to your east. You see

been removed, and what is left of it is scattered about. The roof is missing
and you can see the skies swirling in a clockwise pattern.

cross made of white gold encrusted above the entryway. It looks as if this
must have been the temple used for worship. It looks virtually
unharmed, maybe the darkness could not permeate the good of this
sacred place.

It's Not the Fall That Kills You it's the Sudden Stop at The Bottom~
     You step out off of the ledge and physics takes a quick look at you
floating out there in mid-air and recoils in horror. Physics decides to let
you know who's boss, and brings the force of gravity into play on your body.
You begin to accelerate downward. Given how high you are and the average
viscosity of air, you would hit the ground at an alarming rate of 150 mph.
Let us assume for a moment that the air is quite viscus today, and you only
hit the ground at 95 mph. The fact is you still die...

   My friend, You have entered the realm of the Dane.  Beware!  I have never
seen magic and power as they possess in my life.  I thought all the stories of
power and items were just old wives tales, but when I entered here I tell you
they are true.  I am known by many as Realm.  I am the only survivor that I
know of that has gotten out safely, but somehow they took something from me, I
know not what it is.  My friend, read my signs as you enter the Dane.  They
should help you stay alive hopefully!

base statue message~
   My friends, past these statues lie the feared Rakshasa.  These unique demons
were summoned by the Dane to toy with anyone who desires to enter their temple.
These demons eat and breath fire, they also have the power to summon!  If you
fight them, be prepared to fight them to the death, because if you flee, they
will summon you!  You can't believe the fustration I had when trying to flee
from twenty of these lion like creatures, but to find myself fighting them once
again almost immediately.  --Realm.

The Fire of Tabalina~
   Rising from beneath the lava, an enormous, beautifully slender woman pulls
out hands and lays them over the lava.  Her staring eyes are deep green and her
hair is brown.  You notice her purple lips move, saying, "Climb onto my hands.
" She has two earrings that hang down from her ears.  On her bare skin, you
notice a necklace with some writings.  She seems immune to the lava and fire
that blazes around her.

   To whomever has made it thus far: Eons ago, A man named Realm learned the
art of magic and fighting at a very young age.  By the time he turned 18, he
became a worthy opponent to the most skilled in his arts.  However,the power
that he attained, which always haunt men, wasn't enough for him.  He searched
desperately for more.  When finally it looked as if he had reached his
pinnacle, he dared to challange the gods by killing those even the gods so
loved.  Creatures of all types screamed out in horror, "PKILLER!  " Realm loved
pkilling so much that he trained another by the name of Tabalina to aid his
destructive behavior.  Eventually, the gods finally could not take no more.  
They plotted a devious scheme to trick Realm and his beloved Tabalina to enter
a place where they can attain even greater power.  Realm was so excited of the
new power, he gave directions to all who wish to follow his path.  But to Realm
and Tabalina suprise, we the gods made this rock to hold them for enternity.  
But to the gods suprise, Realm and Tabalina's hatred of this plot was so great,
their combined power has kept this place intact.  We the gods, have created a
very powerful place, yet we no longer have the power to destroy or change
anything in it.  BEWARN!  THERE IS ONLY ONE DIRECTION IN THE ROCK CASTLE!  
THERE IS NO TURNING BACK!  IF YOU SHOULD ENTER HERE, YOU CAN ONLY LEAVE UPON
REALM AND TABALINA'S DEATH!  KNOW THIS, IF YOU SHOULD DEFEAT THEM, THEY ARE
ENTERNAL, AND WILL ARISE ANOTHER DAY!  --SLICER THE GOD OF POWER!

This entire section of Realm seems to breath with its own life.
The sounds of battle can no longer be heard, in fact the only sound
that can be heard is a pulsing eminating from the walls.  A likewise
square has been cut into the floor.  Down through the hole you can
see Rick the Handsome and the Sanctuary Fountain bubbling away.

   You are standing on an icy ledge, which leads along the edge of the
great glacial rift.    To the west, you can see a path, which leads south-
wards, away from the rift.  To the east, the ledge continues, almost
halfway along the edge of the rift.

An icy cave~
   You are standing in a small cave, which lies open to the outside to
the west.  A large crevice leads eastwards, and there might be a light
of some kind in that general direction.   This room looks to be about
man sized, much smaller than the other rooms in this complex.  It is
doubtful a giant would just wander in here, without a reason.

wind, and snow has built up on the icy ground.   You might faintly hear
noises to the east, but it may just be a trick of the wind

Nazgyl's Haunt~

Standing at the edge of the abyss you cannot see to the other side,
and you suspect that there IS no other side.  Nor can you see to
the bottom.  What you CAN see is a flight of stairs chisled out of
the stone, leading down into the blackness.  Although the stairs
look safe enough, there rises from the pit a feeling that grabs hold
of your soul and fairly hurls you away from the cavern.  You would
do well to stay out of there.

buzzing with flies sitting on counters and piles of dishes stacked
to the ceiling.  Maybe if you are low on cash, they would pay you
to clean the place up a bit.  Maybe.

hang heavily, death lurks here you feel it!  The walls are made of huge 
logs interlocked and bound with mud and rope, climbing would be difficult.

A lustrous metallic hump slowly mounds above the edge of
the stone wall surrounding the well. It draws up into a
bulk, rising impossibly of its own accord, like water
standing in the air, only it isn't water. Its glossy
surface reflects everything about it, like polished armor,
distorting the images reflected off its surface as it
grows and moves. It looks like living quicksilver. The
lump, joined to the body of it in the well as if by a
neck, continues to contort, bending into edges and planes,
folds and curves. It warps into a woman's face.
- 'You have called me? You wish to travel?'

Welcome to Ruins of Prophecy!
This zone consists of several different areas:
The Chapel (west) - the Sisters of the Light built this little
   sanctuary after the destruction of their palace.
The Palace Ruins (north) - Not much left but the Sleepwalker
   resides here now, so be careful.
The Hagen Woods (east/north) - It is said that there are some
   vile creatures living in these woods..
Palace Tower & Dungeon (far north) - these are the best
   preserved parts of the palace. They are still in use, or
   maybe its the former inhabitants that refuse to leave...

trees, sprouting with white flowers, just touching the
water creating small ripples in the still pond.

A Pond~
A mist is thickening over a bubbling pond, stealing slowly,
silently, into the surrounding trees. Branches hold not
only their own leaves, but vines of every sort spiraling
around, and pale moss hangs in wispy curtains, nearly
closing off all the light from above.

A field of rocks and rare-looking trees have appeared around

the intimidating woods that surround it. Some of the bushes

by rocks from the palace.

A Hall~
Down this hall, carpets of intricate designs but dull
colors cover the floor. There is no furniture except a
couple of low, leather-covered chests holding oil lamps.
A window near the top of one wall casts the narrow room
in dim light. A streak of light shines on a plaque beside
you.

Kolo's Room~
The room is round, perhaps sixty feet across, its
walls scorched in ragged lines as if lightning had
gone wild in the place. A circular stone wall takes
up the center, like a huge Well, nearly half the width
of the room. Above is a domed ceiling nearly as high
as the room is wide. There are no windows, just a
blown out doorway. To the far side, you can see a
table and a few shelves.

You look down the well and see a reflection. The well is

racing up the shaft with impossible speed, roaring with a
howling shriek of velocity as it comes. The howl grows as
the thing rush upward. The Sliph is ready to travel.

The Jocopo Treasure~
You hold up a torch to shed light on this dark passageway,

up in an expansive room, the torchlight reflects back
in thousands of golden sparkles from the room filled
with gold in nearly every form, from nuggets and crude
ingots to golden statues.

You spot a small, grassy lawn encircling a low stone
wall around a great pit. You hang over the stone wall,
looking into the bottomless abyss. In the stillness
of Ischades protective shields, there is a distant
rumbling. A rumbling of life. The stone beneath your
feet quakes. Dirt particles float in the jittering
air. She is awake.

pit sliph well~
A lustrous metallic hump slowly mounds above the edge of
the stone wall surrounding the well. It draws up into a
bulk, rising impossibly of its own accord, like water
standing in the air, only it isn't water. Its glossy surface
reflects everything about it, like polished armor,
distorting the images reflected off its surface as it grows
and moves. It looks like living quicksilver.

- The lump, joined to the body of it in the well as if by a
neck, continues to contort, bending into edges and planes,
folds and curves. It warps into a woman's face.

Water stretches on all around you.  To your south, you can see a large rock
spire, reaching out into the sky.  The island looks small from here, but its

abominable isle, it seems the clouds part before passing overhead.  The
moon in the sky allows a faint, silvery illumination of the isle.  You can
see a mouth in the northern side of the island.

The mouth of the island swallows you and your party whole.  The only light
here is from the moon, outside of the cave, which of course, helps you
little here.  The waves constantly keep you on guard, and a little further
south, into the cave, you can see a ledge.  A set of stairs are built into
the cave wall and travel from the ledge to the base of a larger cavern set
almost ten feet above the water.  It's darkness heads south, into the island.

strange objects, located on the side of the room.  They appear to be dark
rocks, but are not attached to the cave floor.  It is as if they had been
rolled there.

sides, to the ground.  It seems to be pumping air from the ceiling.  As
you enter the room, the machine's pumping motion stops, and it suddenly
lowers its body to the floor.  A strange headpiece rises from its black
body, as two red pinpoints of light form on its surface.

golems pace about, guarding their area's from any intruders.  You're not
sure where this hall leads, but from the sheer number of armored golems
placed about, you expect whatever it is to be of significant importance to
someone.

A branch off of the hallway~
You emerge from the hallway into a room.  It is actually more of a branch
off of the hall.  This area looks as if it is under heavy construction, as
many large mechanical golems pound at the walls, slowly adding pace onto
the hall.  As you step in, a couple golems stop working, and begin to
approach you.

On top of the island~
You have reached the top of the stairway, and the island.  High above you,
millions of stars liter the sky.  The air is calm, and warm.  No hint of
air flow lives up here.  You are standing on the western most side of the
top of the island.  Jagged sections of rock climb out of sections of the
island before you, and reach into the sky.  Above the rocks, to the east,
where you believe the center of the island to be, you see a large stone
column, rising steadily into the night sky.  At its top is a large array
of pillars, holding the column's roof up, allowing the top of the column
to be open to the outside.  A strange blue light seems to be emanating from
there.  A brick path gives you a direction to follow, it heads to the east.

Before the crater~
You head to the east a ways, and suddenly realize a down turn in the brick
path.  It heads down into a small crater-like formation in the island, where
you suddenly spot hundreds of large humanoid shapes below.  It's too dark
to see exactly what they are, but from where you stand, they look like well
armored golems, but not like the ones previously encountered.  These are
much more slender, and appear better armed for combat.  Their arms appear
to home large blades on the end, and their bodies are well armored.  They
seemed to be amassed in a strange fashion, very orderly, like a troop of
soldiers about to march into combat.  The path leads down to them, and past
them.  You couldn't possibly take them all on at once.  Perhaps if you snuck,
or ran by, quickly

You carefully walk down the path, trying not to be noticed by the awaiting
army below.  The further you walk, more terrain becomes visible to you that
was previously blocked by the crater's edge.  There are more soldiers down
here than you had previously guessed.  Hundreds of them are lined up,
awaiting a battle.  They all appear to be facing the north, and remain
motionless.  You have a ways to travel in secrecy before you are in the
clear.  The path remains constantly heading east, where it will begin
heading up the other side of the crater.

voice in your head.
"Who are you to barge onto my island, and slay my precious creations!?"
A dark arm extends from the robe, and points toward you.
"Let's see how you like the fury of several of my creations all at once!"
A bright light suddenly fills your senses, and you can not see.

Countess Arianna's Sitting Room~
     This room is a cozy, feminine retreat.  The overstuffed furnishings invite you to sit and relax.  There is a bookcase beckoning you to browse the titles bound in enfan hide.  Knick-knacks grace the table and a basket of eedlework waits beside a chair covered with a rich floral pattern.

     As you step further into the room, your feet sink into plush polar bear skins carpeting the floor.  Your eyes are drawn to a beautifully crafted case with glass doors, displaying an impressive collection of weapons, some glowing - all ready for use.  On the walls there are maps framed with the finest Treant wood, each signed simply "with love".  You become aware that the Lady Arianna is a complex woman, equally at home with a sword or a needle in her hand.

Lord Morgrah's Quarters~
     You enter the Guild Masters room with a bit of trepidation for being summoned. The rumors about thing that have happened in this room abound with tales of harsh reprimands and sever punishment. One such rumor spring to mind. It is about a new young clan member that constantly begged the older member for equipment and advancement in the clan. On the floor are thick woven rugs of a strange design that were a gift from the Psionisist Rah.  On the walls are various weapons collected by Morgrah off dead monsters and other denizen that had crossed him.

rug rugs~
     As you look at the rugs you notice an intricate pattern woven in to the fine stout wool. Looking closer at the pattern makes your head start to swim and your knees as wobbly as a newborn foal taking its first steps. As the room starts spinning you cling to the though that maybe the roomers are not so far fetched.

Back Room~
     This is the back room of the Inn of Last Resort. There is not a spec of dust on the floor or a crate out of place. This is where all the food and beverages of the Inn are stored. The stock boy standing here looks like he would be more at home in a stable than in the back room of a Five Sword Inn. Mishia also has the task of helping the members get to the dream world and is very skilled at all his tasks.

The room is sparsely decorated in a simple fashion.  Rice paper matchstick blinds cover the windows.  There is a small meditation mat in the corner.  You get a feeling of serentiy as you enter this room.

The Entrance to the Castle of the Sun~
   You float before the massive floating fortress of the Keepers, the
Castle of the Sun.  A large guardian floats in front of a giant Portcullis
and Gate, and then layered by further magical defenses beyond detection.
Below you lies the expansive mountains near Sanctuary and in the distance
you can see the thriving city.

The Entrance Hallway~
   This wide corridor leads into the heart of the Castle of the Sun, the
dwelling place of the Keepers.  To the north lies the center of the keep,
which is an open air circle, with various rooms and corridors skirting its
edges.  Various servants mill about in the courtyard along with various
animals, from cows to hens.  A massive tree of some sort rises from the
direct center of the courtyard, where a large, marble fountain stands.
The grass is bright green and the air is fresh.

The Fountain Square~
   You gasp as you enter this huge square.  A great Ortugh tree is
standing tall and proud here.  You have only seen the tree in vague
pictures and you have heard about it in old tales.  It is said that this
tree produces travel berries, which are often used by experienced
adventurers.  A lot of people are gathered here for friendly chatter, and
they drink from a fountain which is placed nearby.  The Castle surrounds
the square in a perfect circle at the far edges of the grassy castle
grounds, just like the shape of the sun.  Large towers rise from the
circular walls, housing the Keepers' private rooms, shops, etc.  To the
far north lies the Tower of the Sun, the central tower of the Castle.  A
small shute leads down near the fountain, where the ancient portal room
can be accessed, buried deep in the mountain.

portals resemble the finest workmanship in the known world.  The portals

in a corner.  The barkeep is a huge man, and behind him hangs a battleaxe.
You are certain that he must be a former adventurer.  A few fellow
adventurers are gathered at the tables and they seem to be gambling.  A
beautiful redhead approaches you with a smile and asks you if you want
food and drink.  To the north lies the entrance to the small sparring
field, where the Keeper's sharpen their skills and engage in friendly
duels.  To the east is the small donation room where fellow Keeper's leave
equipment they no longer need.

In the Hidden Tower~
   Grey mist forms about your feet and chills run down your spine as
the squeaky wooden door from which you came slowly closes.  You look around
and notice your standing on the tombs of fallen masters.  Huge spider webs
litter the walls and ceilings, bats hang from the rafters and, rats scurry
past your feet.  The room is lit but with few candles along the walls.  A 
shadow of a large man is cast upon the wall to your right you turn and see
nobody is there.  Suddenly, a light raspy voice draws your attention to an 
old pale looking man sitting in a large high-backed stone throne brandishing
his dagger of pitch-black color.  He speaks as if he hasn't spoken in a thousand 
years, "Cirions shroud of mystery hath fallen once again, young traveler."

wall hangs a weapons rack holding various weapons of master craftsmanship.
Sitting in another corner is a strange musical instrument that looks like
a Saxaphone.  Along the other wall is a armor rack holding some old
battlegear of the brave warrior.  And along the final wall is a desk with
bits of paper scattered about.  Some are songs written in an ancient
dialect.  And some papers are notices of renshai's plan and workings.

on it. Hanging from the ceiling is a banner marked with the Renshai
Symbol.  The floor made of black marble, which devours the light from the
torches along the walls. Centered on the northern most wall above the huge
fireplace hangs the Blade of the Western Wizard, crossed over with The
DemonSlayer.  On an armor rack to the left of the fireplace can be seen
the ashen sash of the Renshai. To the right of the fireplace is a glass
case holding the Symbol of Nehimdais and the chain link bracelets always
worn by the DemonSlayer himself.  There is a very comfortable chair by the
fire, well used and always ready for its master.

You are standing in the center point of the Black Tower. This is the largest 
room of Black Tower, fortress of legend, and stronghold of mankind. While 
nations and empires rose and fell, were replaced and fell anew, the Black 
Tower stood. The rock on which armies had broken spears, swords, and hearts, 
a monument to the power of the Phantom. This room is the spine of the tower. 
All points of the tower are accessible from here, and when you look around, 
you still can't get over how huge this room is. You feel calm and assured as 
you look deep into the cool fountain. If you were thirsty, you could drink, 
if you were tired, you could rest. The power of this fortress surrounds you, 
and you feel safer than you ever have.

name by which Lewis Therin was known during the War of the Shadow, some 
three thousand or more years ago. In the madness that overtook all male Aes 
Sedai, Lewis Therin killed everyone who carried any of his blood, as well as 
everyone he loved, thus earning the name Kinslayer. This statue is a 
Ter'angreal of great power and you only wish you knew how to use it.

Picking up the book you start to feel nervous about what awaits within the 
book. Should you read it? Do you want to know the ways of Phantom? Secrets, 
ideas, everything and anything. Your hands start to sweat at the thought of 
knowing all of Phantom's secrets. You really want to know what's in this

barely see what appear to be two statues at the passage end.  The
passage continues to the West, and the fork is East of here.

West Passage~
   You continue along the passage, and from here, you can see the statues
a bit more clearly.  They look like statues of squat, ugly Gargoyles.  You
wonder who would bother to carve such ugly statues all the way down
here.  The passage continues to the West and East.

End of West Passage~
   You have reached the end of the Western passage, and see a cavern to the
South.  The statues look so life-like, you would swear they were real if they
only moved.  As you draw nearer to one of them, it suddenly lashes
out fiercely with its sharp, stony claws.

Margoyle Cavern~
   This is the home of the stone creatures, called Margoyles.  An especially
large one is here, eyeing you with bloodlust in its granite eyes.   Bones of
every type of creature litter the cavern, explaining the lack of
life around here.  If you live, you may exit this cavern by going North.

North Passage~
   You travel along the Northern passage, which is much rougher than the
other passages you have traveled on.  Sharp rocks litter the passage, and
you have to be careful not to slip or cut yourself on the jagged
rocks.  The passage continues to the North and the passage fork is to the
South.

End of North Passage~
   You have reached the end of the Northern passage, however, there is a
medium sized natural cavern to the West.  The cavern has an unusual amount
of stalactites.  They outnumber the stalagmites by more than four to one.
As you are trying to count them, a few seem to be moving around a bit.

Exit from the Cavern Maze (Blocked)~
   You have reached the exit from this condusing maze of twisting passages.
However, at this time the exit is blocked by a huge iron gate with no lock.
Watch your step, though.  In the center of the passage is a gaping hole.
As you peer over the edge, you are overwhelmed by the blackness within, and
detect a great evil power nearby.  Some narrow steps wind down into the
chasm.

gold, silver, and platinum were used to craft the many fine fixtures. The
size of hall need to hold all these riches is vast. So vast that you must
have travelled a mile to get to your present location, although you
have taken a few steps inside.   Exits lead in all directions.

Entrance to the Prodigian War Academy~
     As you look, you notice that this is not an academy at all.  It is
more of a fort-like structure like a castle with a moat.  The entrance
way looks very old and is probably made of gold or silver.  There is a
big sign here that reads:
            WARNING TRAINING PROGRAM IN PROGRESS.   PLEASE DONT DISTURB.
            ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!   PLEASE NOTE, "APPEARANCES  ARE
            DECEIVING."

King Graham and his family.  Daventry is a place where sudden violence

Woodcutter's Cottage~

Crispin's House~

His only companion is Cedric, an owl who helps him keep his house and
thoughts together in order.  You can sense that this house is not man
made and that Crispin's magic is keeping it together in one piece.

Ant Hill~

fellow ant subjects.  We think little of ants, other than to curse
its presence at picnics and bemoan its ability to stream into out
kitchens during rainy weather.  You might say that this is King
Antony's throne room.

An Obvious Death Trap~
     As you step into this room, you begin to notice that you are travelling
at a very fast speed.  You think that you are travelling at 0.9c because
you can see time distortions everywhere.  Suddenly, you stop and notice
that you are in the middle of Silurius 5 in the Alpha Quadrant.  Every
cell in your body begin to explode due to the absence of air pressure.
How agonizing and painful.  Don't you hate this.  I hope you learned
your lesson about rooms saying that they are obvious death traps.
Have a nice day!!!!!!!!!

made of a strange material which is glowing with a blue light.

The Prodigian Tower~
     This is the power source center of the Prodigians.  From here, they
can monitor their captives in their artificial domains.  The tower is
partially camouflage with a time barrier that protects them from uprisings
by their captives.  Once in a while, their captives would rebel.  You 
would think that this place is heavily fortified but it is not due to 
some uncertain reason.

or place as they wish.  The only problem is that the time manipulator
does produce certain nasty side effects to the user.

Sesame Street.  The little buggers are everywhere!!!  You have to hack
your way through the crowds of smelly little brats that seem to have
infested the place.  This isn't the Sesame Street of yore; this place is a zoo!
To the north you see a smelly old dump where all the Sesame Street refuse
is kept.  The wind changes, bringing an awful smell to your nose.  What on
earth could live there?

You fight your way through the trash and garbage and smelly little kids.  All
around you are broken toys and games, destroyed after years, or maybe only
hours of abuse.  As you kick the broken Barbie dolls out of your way,
a huge pile of particularly offensive bright orange balls drops onto your
head.  You hear a tiny pip-squeak of a voice giggle and you curse back at it.

you up.  You nonchalantly decapitate a few, making the others clear off and
give you some room.
To the north, you see a set of stairs which lead up to an apartment building
of some sort.  Through one of the open windows you can here someone
serenading a rubber ducky.  You feel sorry for the poor guy at first, but
then you can understand why he'd rather be with his rubber ducky than this
evil hoard of miscreant youth.

Bert and Ernie's Place~
This place may be making a philosophical statement about the dualism of
man, but maybe not.  Half the room is an absolute mess, covered with 
rusty paperclips, old unwashed clothing, and massive balls of lint, while
the other half so painfully neat that you're almost afraid to walk there
for fear of disrupting even a molecule of its anal platitudes.  You try
to weave your way in between the two regions, without actually entering
either.

This is either a kitchen or a murderer's playroom.  Sharp knives, heavy pans,
and other really strange items that are either used for cooking or as 
instruments of torture are strewn all about.  Every so often a dead fish 
comes flying in through the window, sometimes landing at your feet, and 
other times swinging out in a wide arc and exiting out another window. Piles 
of fish in various states of dismemberment and decomposition are here giving
off a rather putrid odor.

little building full of fishnets to climb and loaded with zillions of 
little rubber balls to tumble in and throw at each other.

The Entrance to Muppet Forest~
This forest is made up of muppet trees.  These trees like to mix people
up.  They move around changing which way the path goes.  The trees are
tall enough to black the light from above.  The path goes in all

This room seems more like a lair than a cell. Small bits of hay lie
strewn about the floor covering bones of unknown origin. Spattered blood
and tufts of grey hair lie matted in one corner. As you turn to

the go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher then other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.

The silvery cord that you are ascending extends beyond the realm
of consciousness.   You can see the cord extending into another realm,
that seems much different from the world of Sanctuary.  You take a short
break from climbing and catch a glimpse of the world around you.  The
cord in which you began to climb extends downward to a tiny globe.  Wait
a minute...that globe looks familiar...its Sanctuary!  All around you are
the stars and pitch black sky.  You can identify the major
constellations, and you only hope that the silvery cord in which you
climbed leads to a familiar place.  A shadowy shape slowly fades into
existence from the starry background.  You think it would be a good
idea to continue onward.

unlike the savage world that you are accustomed.  The meadow extends
northward to a paved road which extends beyond the range of your vision.
The view from this hill is awesome.  You have an excellent aerial view
of this strange place.  To the northeast is gigantic mountain, extending
above the clouds, that towers above the lands below.  To the northwest is
vast ocean stretching out of sight.  You can also make out a city at
the end of the great paved road to the north.

road design, but you know better.  To the north the road extends northward to
the great city on the horizon.  To your east you see the beginning of a
great forest that makes Mirkwood seem feeble in comparison.

that someone is monitoring your progress.  To the west is a large
building.  As you peer at the building the architecture seems quite foreign
to you.  There are large columns with bas reliefs of great battles supporting
the roof.  You hear the sound of laughter and cheering from inside the
building.  There is also a large insignia of the arched entrance of a
huge sword.  You are overwhelmed by the feeling of safety which
issues forth from the building.

are several armored men and women talking to each other, they all stare
at you as you enter, then quickly return to the business.  Along the
walls of this building are larger pictures of fabled monsters and
fearless men fighting to the death.  You also can make out a smaller
exit to the north that seems hidden.  To the north you can hear the
the sounds of water splashing against great rocks.

You have arrived at the eastern edge of the Great Ocean.  There are huge
boulders scattered along the rocky coast.  As the ocean collides with
boulders you feel uneasy.  It reminds you that the strange lands in which
you have entered are filled with great mystery.  Looking out to sea you
can make out several rocky islands.  Only great legends speak of what
lies on those unexplored lands.  There are men here building sea faring
vessels, and you can see a large man directing them.  These ships are
unlike any you have seen before and they seem able to withstand the
mighty ocean unlike the rafts and canoes in which you are so familiar.

ocean and to the east the path twists into a mysterious forest.

Unlike the city of Sanctuary, this city does not need any walls to

Chariots are passing through at a such rapid pace, you almost have to
actively dodge them.  To the north is the Palace and Grand Hall of the
ruler of Graecia.  To the east and west, paved roads extend throughout
the town.  As you look to the east you can see buildings built of
fine materials such as marble and obsidian, while to the west the
shadows make the road look a bit threatening.  A paved road also
extends to the south gate of town.

Scholars and wise men make up the court of King Agamemnon.  You have
intercepted a great debate.  As you enter the scholars recognize that you
are foreigners and hail your arrival.  King Agamemnon welcomes you to
the land of Graecia and bids you a safe journey.  He is seated on a
throne of pure gold embedded with so many jewels that the sunlight
reflected from them nearly blinds you.  You consider stealing some of
the jewels, but you realize that Agamemnon could smite you if you
angered him.  At his side, Clytemnestra, his wife, smiles
with a glint of betrayal in her eyes.  After greeting you the court
ignores you and returns to their discussion.  There are also large
columns here providing tall deep shadows and occasionally you can see a
figure dart in between them.  You realize that even the brave
Agamemnon is not without enemies and this land of Graecia is not as
peaceful as it seems.

The Dim Alley~
The paved road that you have been accustomed now takes on a different
look.  The bricks are no longer neatly laid in place, and the buildings
that you pass are progressively in worse condition.  Occasionally you
see a shadowy figure in the corner of your eyes.  Whenever you try to
catch a glimpse of the figure, it disappears into the shadows.  Your
progress to the west is blocked by a wooden wall.  You wonder why a
wooden wall is in the middle of the street, then you see some movement
behind the wall.  An arrow strikes the ground at your feet, and you
realize that that was only a warning shot.  Obviously, it would be a
good idea to leave this area quickly.

fortresses with flowing fountains and beautiful gardens latently behind
the walls of these buildings.  You would think that there would be a
crime problem in this area, but the multitude of guards in the area
suggests otherwise.  To the east is the Main Plaza and to the west

You have entered the grand estate of Nero.  There are fountains,
colloseums, statues, and many other fine sculptures in this area.
There is a large horse seated on a throne here.  The horse prances
proudly as you enter.  For such a large estate, it seems strange that
there are not any workers scurrying around looking busy.  In fact it is
rather quiet.  Only the statues and the Horse are here to greet you.  A
man walks by and whispers that Hercules is the only worker employed by
Nero.  It must be truly a Herculean task to keep this place in order.
Paths lead in all directions into the countryside, while to the
east you can see the edges of town.

End of the Path~
You have reached the end of a small path through the estate of Nero.
All is quiet hear..In fact all of the sounds that you are normally
accustomed to are no longer present.  To the west you can see an area
sheltered from the elements.  It seems to be a cave of a burrow of some
sort.  A strong smell of death and decay comes from the mouth of the
cave.  The wind begins to increase in force from the west and the stench
becomes overpowering.  You realize whatever is making that horrid
stench must be a formidable creature.

Den of the Nemean Lions~
You have entered the home of the Nemean Lion.  You can tell that many a
great warrior have perished here by the decoration of skulls and bones
that are scattered throughout the den.  You also notice several bodies
in different stages of decay, in fact you can even make out the insignia
of the Graecian town guard on some of the corpses.  You realize that
whatever is powerful enough to destroy the Graecian guard is indeed
a force to be reckoned.

Hidden Swamp~
As you push your way through the overgrown area you realize that you
have stumbled upon a small clearing.  As you look at your feet, you
realize that you are standing in a small swamp or pond.  The stench of
the stagnant water is unbearable.  You feel a small current moving
through the water as if SOMETHING were moving about your feet in the
water.  Suddenly, a creature with ten large heads leaps from the
swamp and rushes to attack!

The Arbory~
This is an isolated arbory in the estate.  Beautiful trees and delicious
apples grow here.  You are overcome by a sense of peace and content.
You start to feel sleepy and it becomes difficult to keep your eyes
open.  Suddenly, you hear a scream from the north and you spring to your
feet!  To the north you now see a gate, hidden by a large tree.  You
hear another scream, then the area is overcome by great silence.  As you
get a better look of the area you also see a small stream to the west.

Amazon Village~
Past the gates is a small community of Amazons living in a well
concealed area of the estate.  All of the women are in excellent
physical condition and by the size of their arms, they look like
formidable opponents.  As you enter the village they look at you with a
blank and ominous stare.  You can see corpses of several ferocious
creatures over a large fire in the center of the village.  Obviously
they know how to use their weapons quite well.  To the south you can see
a hidden trail leading a small arbory, and to the north you can see
what appears to be a combat area.

You can see the Champion, Queen Hippolyta, practicing with several of
her bravest warriors.  She invites you into the ring, grabs her spear,
and prepares to meet your challenge.

The Pasture~
You have entered the pasture of Nero's Prize Oxen, Geryon.  This oxen is
not like any mere cow that you have ever seen.  Nero's prize Oxen is
carefully guarded by a huge, overbearing giant and his faithful two
headed dog.  The giant grins as you enter and carefully clutches his
club.  That club looks like it could smash boulders with a single blow.
You can see that the path continues to the south leading upwards
into the hills.

The Great Mound~
You have finally made the climb on to the top of a huge mound.  There is
a single sapling on this hill.  Growing on the tree are some golden
apples.  You remember that these apples were supposed to be guarded by
some horrible beast, but there seems to be no sign of him now.  As you
take a second glance at the mound you see a suspicious hole concealed by
some debris.  The hole seems to be the home of some great monster, and
judging by the scales scattered around it only one thing comes to
mind.  That must be the home of a DRAGON!!!

before you can react, a Huge Dragon is upon you.

great forest.  Finally, to the south and west you can see the vast ocean
and islands along the coast.  Standing here are two giants.  They look
at each other and grin evilly.  One assumes a wrestling stance and the
other grabs a huge club.  They move towards you with the intent of
battle.

The trees seem to reach towards you with their twisted and gnarled
branches.  With closer inspection, you see some very strange tracks
leading into the forest, reinforcing the rumors that the forest is
haunted by strange creatures.  To the west a familiar path leads to
the Great Paved Road and to the east the path winds into the
dense forest.

This is the place where the unlucky prisoners are drawn and quartered.
There is a large iron plate in the middle of the room, with four
shackles, one at each corner.  Attached to each shackle is a huge chain
and great crank.  The torturers that run this place kill you very
slowly, and prolong the agony.  But remember this is Hades, you cant
die, you only get to do it again tommorrow.  To the west is a
forgotten hallway.

On either side of the hardly visible path, rises the tall prairie grass
common to the plains.  The path continues to the west and there seems to

marble.  A ways to the north, you see what appears to be a massive temple 
looming up from the flat landscape.  It appears to be very ancient as it
is heavily weathered and broken.

you can't see the dirt anymore.  The cobblestones are actually large
blocks of white marble, about 2 feet square and perfectly joined together.
It becomes wider and wider as it leads up to a wide set of stairs that
leads up to the top of the...  Ruins...  To the north.

leading about one-hundred feet up the side of the ruins.  On every step
there appears to be four glowing runes one shaped like a stone, another
like a flame, another like a tornado, and the last one looks like a wave.
The flat plains spread out in all directions from the ruins.

Something.  The wind whips around you and in the distance you can see the
city of New Thalos, like a speck on the horizon.  You can also see what
looks like an impact ridge surrounding the ruins about a mile out, in a
perfect circle, as if a huge explosion took place.

The Ruins of Ascore~

On a large piece of raised stone, lies an INSCRIPTION, written in Common.
To the north spreads the main hall of the ruins.  The center contains only
fallen boulders and charred pieces of what used to be the roof.  The only
structures still intact are 4 pillars, stationed at the 4 corners of the
ruins.  They appear to glow with an eerie light.  The floor here is
blackened and some are slightly melted from what must have been a massive
explosion.

inscription~
   Here lies the remnants of the great city of Ascore.  This tower used to
be the main temple of the city, until an errant Minor God descended from
the heavens to wreck havoc upon this, the mightiest city at the time.
Many attempts were tried to stop him, but all failed.  We, the descendents
of the Ascore people, the Mongols, called on the help of the Four Mages,
the four most powerful mages in the world, all representing different
elemental forces.  They came to this site to stop the God, and by
combining their mighty powers, they managed to entrap the God beneath this
temple, but not destroy him.  During the course of this battle the magical
forces began to tear apart the very fabric of reality itself, causing an
explosion of such intensity, the whole city was disintegrated, except for
this temple.  The magic the Mages had to cast was so powerful, it drained
their very life forces, and they were turned to stone where they stood.
They infused the four pillars surrounding the center of the Temple with
their respective elemental magic and created guardians to guard it.  Each
guardian holds the Mage's own magical equipment and a magical stone, which
can undo the barriers beneath the temple, that which restrain the God.  We
trust noone will ever open those barriers, for that will surely be the end
of the world, which is why we have created this inscription, so the
curious will not be lured to take the treasures of this temple.  Please
Traveller, do not go furthur into this temple...
The Great Sage of Ascore,
   Mongolian Shaman, Kublas Ferna Khan

The Ruins of Ascore~
   A lightning bolt strikes the center of the ruins to the north,
illuminating a scene of fallen boulders and pieces of the long gone roof.
The cracked floor under your feet is blackened and charred from what must
have been a massive explosion.  To the west and east lie glowing pillars,
and what appears to be a creature standing underneath each one.

The Entrapped Minor God!!!!~
   You are suddenly plunged into a swirling chaos of streaming magic and
poisonous gas.  A MASSIVE figure, glowing brightly charges at you,
assaulting you with harsh magics and its mighty fists!  The ground
trembles and your soul shakes as the full fury of a GOD is unleashed on
you!

The Altar of Ascore~
   The air is musty here and smells as if its been here for thousands of
years.  A pair of golden stairs leads up to a great, golden altar.  On top
of the altar lies a fragment of vapourous green matter with a handle, a
sword of some kind.  The air pulsates with magic and you notice a small,
silver hatch in the floor, slightly glowing.

In Mirkwood~
   You are deep in the heart of the forest of Mirkwood.  Your passage south
is blocked by a rush of water that looks better left untouched.  If you
had a boat, you could continue south, otherwise you can go north or west
through some thick cobwebs.

  You are standing on a path, which leads north to the dark river, and 
south towards some sort of building, although you are not sure of the type.
The trees tower above you, and block all light, making it impossible to see
without the aid of light or magic.  You hear scurrying all around,
as small creatures rush through the undergrowth.

the middle of the path shows signs of wear from the many travelers and
horses that have passed this way throughout the ages.  The path is dim,
and some light may be required up ahead. Fresh droppings from a
strange animal abound here.  It's tracks are not large, but instead,
seem claw-like. The trees nearby seem strange as well; almost
lifelike.  There is an especially large tree to the west.

Eastern mountains.  The shaft leads in an east west direction  , and there
is a definite downward slope to the east.  The twin rails in the floor
stop here, and a crude platform of wooden planks extend deeper into
the mine shaft.  You continue to hear strange noises from the depths.

You are standing at the Northern Entrance to the Gypsy Village. You see
a set of small, makeshift gates to the south which mark the official limit
of the small village. You see that the road south appears to be heavily
used by wagons, as their wheels have carved deep ruts into the ground. The
village seems to be made of an odd mixture of buildings and wagons. The 
Gypsy Trail leads south, into the village, and a small field lies to the 
north. You notice a small sign posted on the rickety gates of the village.

road so quickly, that it still looks well used. One thing is for sure,
and that is that no one can use the road to the north anymore. It is
almost as if the swamp has a purpose here. To the south, you can make
out a small village of caravans.
A sign has been posted at the edge of the swamp.

It has been decreed by the High Council of the Four Caravans that trade
with the Lord of Ravenloft be cut, in an attempt to diminish his evil
power in this land. The High Lords of the Mage's Caravan created this
swamp as a boundary, to ensure that the wishes of the Council would be
heeded. If you are foolish enough to enter, beware, for death lies at
every turn. If you survive the pits of quicksand, you may still be 
caught for all eternity. If you somehow make it through our boundary, then
good luck at surviving the wrath of the Lord of Ravenloft.

You've come to the far end of this small cavern.  Straw mats lay on the ground,
and you see a small cooking fire in near the far wall.  Whoever or whatever

A cavern~
This cavern is rather narrow, and yet somewhat cozy.  Its warm for the first
time in your life(for a cavern, that is) and also, you notice the definitive
lack of any spiders or other 'icky' beings.

A dead end~
The cavern gets quite narrow before being blocked by some rubble.  The rubble
seems to have been put there purposely.  In a somewhat archaic tongue someone
has written the following on the walls:
Do not remove, the rubble keeps the black devils in their prison.

woods.  There is a large man by an oak tree, showing several other people
how to properly string a bow.  He must be Albruin, the guildmaster for this

of the walls of Mordilnia.  You can hear the life of the city, and marvel at
its size.  West of here is a humpbacked bridge, spanning the gap of a small
stream which flows endlessly through the forest.

   You are by two towers that have been built into the hard granite wall
with a strong iron gate in between; wicked, barbed spikes protruding up and
down along every other bar - like the hungry jaws of some demented
nether-beast.  Temple Road runs north and south from here, its dull, cobbled
surface visually muted by the windblown dust which forms a thin line over
its flat surface.  Eastward, you see the Temple of Mordilnia, in all its
modest and holy splendor.

The Temple of Mordilnia~
   The grand, marble floor of this holy house lies unscathed - though many
feet have tread its surface, both bare and shod.  The high-domed ceiling
shows a sky of many shades and hues.  Midway from floor to ceiling,
a balcony-like second floor stands, hand woven tapestries adorning
the smooth granite walls.  From here to the floor above, a grand,
spiralling stairway ascends, its polished cherrywood surface
casting a multitude of tiny daggers of reflected light into your eyes.
Through the arched portal to the west, one can venture to Temple
Road, and the Midwest Gate, leading far out through the wilderlands.

Temple Road~

make up this road, you notice a great vision of greenery to the east.
Turning to look, you see a majestic, gargantuan tree...certainly the largest
oak you've ever seen in a largely populated area.  It's singularity seems to
make it some sort of symbolic presence, like a talisman of ultimate nature
grasped cruelly in the stony talons of society.  The road continues from
here, both to the north and the south.

toward the town wall, and the jewelry shop above.  Glancing westward, you
see a gate leading out of town, while the scenery of the east flows toward
the center of Mordilnia, and a bit past it.
The sounds of a forge can be heard nearby, and you wince at the
deafening reverberations of the hammer as it meets the anvil, sending a
ringing sound through the streets, a sound not unlike that of heavy weaponry
clashing furiously in battle.

the building seemingly levitating in mid-air.  Upon closer inspection,
however, you see that the building is built into the top of the wall
surrounding Mordilnia, with a strong, steel frame stairway leading
up to the front door of the establishment.
   Though the cobbled stone street here is shadowed by the building
above it, the stones have an almost supernatural polished gleam to them, as
if advertising the wares bought and sold daily just atop the stair

walls and ceiling are blackened with heat and grime, giving you a good
impression of a fiery dragon's lair.  The floor is constructed of cobbled
stone, some of which has been worked loose over the years.  A large
assortment of armours and weapons hang from the walls here, and a giant
cauldron of cool, steel-quenching water lies in the center of the
room, waiting to extinguish the metal's heat.

of establishments and small villas lining the streets.
   Diamond Street leads west from here, Blackraven Avenue leads east, and
Phantom Road leads south.  To the north, Wizard Way leads to the

surface in the past.  The building is illuminated by many small candles
hanging from oaken pillars, giving the room a warm, cheery glow.  Many
tables are sitting around the room, and a long, oaken bar sits
against the far wall.

candelabra which hold herb-scented, multicolored candles of a
respected and lovely craft.  Vast, almost limitless tomes containing holy
knowledge fill countless shelves, as well as statuettes depicting deities of
every pantheon and creed.  At the front of the shop, for that is the true
purpose of this otherwise saintly abode, sits a small, mahogany desk
scarred by many years of loving use by quill and scroll.

At the southern edge of the stage, you see a podium, its ebony surface a
grim testament to the death which has been dealt here.
   In the center of the wooden stage, a guillotine stands, solemnly
waiting for its wicked blade to bite into flesh and bone.  Spectators of
past decapitations have always gasped at the meaty thump of a severed
head falling into the blood-lined interior of the bucket below.
   East of here, you see Phantom Road.  East Avenue runs south into South
Street from here, and oddly enough, you see an oak tree shading the
grass of the Town Common to the west.

   You stand on the soft, fragrant grasses of the Town Common, where those
who seek rest or socialization often venture.  You see many indications of
past lounging, such as soft indentations in the grass where someone has
briefly taken seat for lunch or small talk.  Small, wild flowers grow in
dense, well-distributed patches throughout the common, giving you a picture
of simplistic beauty.  A great, towering oak resides west of here, shading
that part of the common and providing an adequate place of slumber.
The only irony to these sights is the existence of the sadistic tool of
death just east of here, a great chopping block for those of unruly nature.

At The Great Oak~
   You stand at the thick base of the gargantuan Great Oak.  Its trunk is as
thick as any building in Mordilnia, a testimony to its great age.  None of the
inhabitants know how or why it is here, but some have guessed that it was
planted millennia ago by a wizened race of Druidic creatures, as a legacy of
their passing, and some traveller set up camp at its base, eventually deciding
to stay, building Mordilnia as a whole around this central figurehead of
nature and beauty.  No one has dared bring blade against this tree, for some
unspoken law, or perhaps a Druidic ritual, has forbade it.
   The Town Common lies east of here, shaded by the branches of the
oak, while the Temple Road is to the west.

that is pulsating through the atmosphere.  Some sort of hypnotic residue
floats through the air here, for your vision blurs and colors change; from

beneath your feet seem to shift restlessly, as if they were tiny, sentient
beings, set on carrying your weight with only their sheer size in numbers.
Then a fresh wind tugs at your face and through your hair, and all is normal
in the world once again.

Blackraven Avenue~
   You are standing at the easternmost end of Blackraven Avenue, which stops
here with the eastern town wall.  The street continues to the west from here,
and to the immediate west you see a spiralling cloud of multicolored gases,
just it front of the Alchemy Shop.  The source of these gases seems to be
a ventilation pipe leading from the roof of the establishment.
Here, it is dead calm.

The House of Supreme Alchemy~
   As you stand in this dim, musty room, you discover that the cloying
smells of exotic spices and strange chemicals are not as strong as they are
out on the street.  In fact, this doesn't look to be a laboratory of any
sort, so the room where the various potions and other oddities are made must
be located in the back somewhere, with a ventilation shaft extending above
the shop.  Here, you see strange, arcane symbols attached to the walls here
and there along with shelves full of bottled liquids and jarred powders.  A
large, stone-carved counter lies in the center of the room, with neatly
stacked papers and other secretarial paraphernalia lining its top.
To the south, you see the street.

which contain and are compromised of all the guilds of every profession.
   The odd construction of these roads has never been full understood...as
if some deranged architect were put to the task of designing a trap
of knowledge for the unwary.

toys for trainees.  All is quiet here, as is the way of the silent
and sure thief.

Double-edged swords and serrated blades, as well as huge axes of war
and weapons designed to literally crush the life out of one's opponent are
carefully, and almost lovingly cleaned and displayed in museum-fasion in
glass cases and velvet-lined chests.  Large, bulky suits of armor rest on
quilted tables and crates, as well as some that have been put up on display.
The room is strangely clean, though that is due to the fact that if it
were not, weapons and armor both would go to ruin in a dry heap of
crimson rust and corrosion.

Deep ruts and large stones make you stumble.  A bit further south is the
river, you can hear it from here.

Wide Way Through the Forest~
   You are traveling a rather wide path along the forest edge west of
Sanctuary.  The path is actually the remains of an old road that once 
carried trade to and from the southern parts of the continent.  Few 
people travel this way nowadays... too dangerous.

grass feed out from the tree and you feel a sense of power
radiating from it. Exits lie north and south along a
cobblestone street and east and west lead into buildings.

this temple is that unlike the rest of the city it seems to be

caused you to start wondering; who could have built this road? how long ago?
what great cities did it connect? The answers must have been lost to modern
lore, or surely in your travels you would have heard some rumor of this place.
The road marches on through the hills, flat, straight, north and south.

the elevation. You notice an overgrown path to the west through the hills, it
shows no signs of having been traveled in these times.

Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that
seems to have grown up through the cracks everywhere. At last you have reached
the mountains. The ancient road does not stop upon reaching the base of the
enormous rock face, however, but disappears into a gigantic tunnel, the mouth
of which has a radius of at least thirty feet. It size permits the light to
extend for some distance into the tunnel - you can see that the road continues
as before.

Winding Path~
    After the easy walk on the ancient road it takes you a little time to get
used to the rough going on this winding trail. The grass and brush has had more
success reclaiming its territory here than it did there, and you find yourself
having to push the vegatation aside at times to get through. The trail is
continually rising, and you find yourself nearer to the mountains to the south
in elevation, if not in actual distance. The track continues east and west.

Path End~
    You have come to the end of the winding path, and only now discover who
must have used it aeons ago. You are on top of a particularly tall hill, one
that gives an excellent view of the grassy plains below. Far to the west
and south you see a glint of blue that can only be the ocean. It is there the
road must have been headed. There is an area of scorched earth here that has
withstood all the wind and rains, from an uncountable number of campfires kept
by the watchmen who once stayed here. The winding path leads back down the
hill to the east.

The Climbing Trail~
    The trail steepens here and you find yourself frequently stopping to catch
your breath. Once in a while you look back and see the hills below you, and the
straight white line that the ancient road makes through the landscape. Far in
the distance to the northeast you can see a blue expanse that must be an ocean,
while nearer it turns into a sea of green, which extends to the east to the
edge of your vision. To the north-west you can see the jungle, beyond the
plains of the Serengetti.  To the north the sheer faces of the cliffs are now
very close, and the trail seems to be taking you right to them.

A Rocky Precipice~
    The trail you've been following ends here on a wide ledge. Long ago, it
must have been lookout used to view the world below. The mountains rise
straight above you, the sheer rock face forming an impassable barrier to
further travel in that direction. To the west you can see a fissure in the
rock; one that is deep enough that you can't see how far it extends. You know
better than to try to get there from here, though, as it would involve scaling
the mountain going west for more than twenty feet, and you'd never make it. The
steep trail heads back down the mountain here, giving you an exit.

    As you grasp the rock you look into a fissure that extends several feet
into the face, getting deeper as it continues up the mountain. Looking out
from the fissure reveals a rocky precipice you could probably reach if you had
wings, but certainly not without. It is very cool in here, as the sun rarely
reaches the recesses of this crack. You figure you can work your way up the
fissure to leave. No other exits are apparent.

    You have entered a natural cavern, formed by the forces of nature over

no one has entered this cavern in ages, if anyone has ever been here at all.
The cave is completely dark aside from your light, the stalagmites cast strange
shadows on the walls around you. In one corner of the room you notice a hole
in the floor of the cave. Extending your light into it reveals it to be leading
into a space whose size is impossible to tell - the floor and walls, if any,

you have the time you will return to work the rock. In the meantime, you can go

What you can see of it appears to be moving. Very odd. From the blackness of
whatever it is that is up there, you think it might be bats. Of course, that
would mean there are lots of them. As this occurs to you, it also strikes you
that it might be a good idea to leave. Like, now.

which merged into a single stream. The southern route was clearly the larger
of the two sources, as the tunnel there is only slightly smaller than the one
into which the two sources converge to the north. The other source looks
like it probably was a minor tributary, as the hole through which it enters
this tunnel is barely large enough to fit through. It leads up and to the
west.

shattered bones strewn about the floor. You have a slightly uneasy feeling, and

your hands to brace yourself against the rock and slide up or down on the

    You are in one half of a gentle S-curve traced by the river bed of a long
dry underground waterway. The passage goes to the south and west from here,
following a gentle upslope to the south.

    The river route is a bit narrower here than it is to the north, and it
looks like it narrows even further to the south. The tunnel here is rougher
going than to the north, as there are obstinate rock outcroppings that have
managed to stave off erosion and snag your clothes when you pass. There is
a small hole in the ceiling of the tunnel here, in addition to the tunnel
leading north and south.

    The passage is quite constricted here in comparison to the roominess it
evinces to the north. Still, traveling single file it can be managed easily
enough. You think you can see what was once the source of the river up ahead
to the south. The ground is starting to rise rather sharply in that direction.

    It is here that the underground river must have had its source. There are
small openings to the west and up as well as to the south. The southern route
is almost too narrow for a person to fit into, and looks like it gets even
smaller. The west passage looks more inviting for humanoid travel. There is
also a tiny hole leading up.

Tiny Fissure~
    You've come as far in this direction as you can, as the rock comes
together above you to prevent passage to anything larger than a small rodent.
Forcing your light up the fissure allows you to see into it a few feet, and
from what you can tell it extends straight up without enlargening at least
that far. The only exit is back down to the river source intersection.

Tributary Path~
    You have come to the end of this river path, as you are in a very small
space where the rocks come together to form an extremely small cave. There iis
a narrow crack in the floor, far too small for travel, out of which you can
hear the sounds of distant water rushing. Once water must have emanated from
this crack, now it flows a different way.

you find yourself forced to you hands and knees at times in order to pass
through narrow spots. Holding your light source in your teeth, you can see
that the passage widens out a bit to the east, while it narrows further and
rises almost vertically as it turns to the north.

Rock Face~
    You have emerged from the narrow tributary path onto a sheer mountain
face. The wind whips by you here at an alarming rate, and you cling desperately
to the rock to avoid being torn from your perch and blown to your death on the
rocks thousands of feet below. From here you can see a running stream a few
hundred feet down the cliff face to the east, where it disappears into another
crevice in the rock on its path to unknown destinations. From the lay of the
land about you it doesn't take long to figure out that the water flowing there
once flowed here, thus explaining the dry bed you've been following. The only
exit for those without wings (or the equivalent) is back down into the rock
face.

so the force of the pull downstream is still possible to resist. You are
having second thoughts about traveling this way, because you can see that to
go much further along the streambed here you are going to need a set of gills.
Water almost completely fills the tunnel along which the stream is flowing to
the east, and it looks like the tunnel drops further and the water rises
higher as it continues. You can still get out of here by leaving up.

to the east. Man this water is cold. And the flow is strong too - it's taking
every ounce of your strength to avoid being swept along with the rushing
current. You can still get out to the west, to the east the water flows out

of the current to the east is irresistable. You can make out a small hole in
the roof of the tunnel here, through which you might be able to fit. You can
also exit west, back to the portion of the channel with air, or to the darkness
visible to the east, towards which the stream is swiftly flowing.

isn't as cold as the stream, but it's still quite uncomfortable. The lake floor
is covered with a sticky mud, which is reason enough for you to continue
swimming rather walking along the bottom. There are a few blind fish darting
about; they are more concentrated to the south and west. They don't seem to
like your light source very much, and move away when you come close. There is
a fairly strong current pulling you to the east. You can also exit up to the
lake surface, west and south to other parts of the lake, and down into a small
hole leading to unknown destinations.

It looks like the lake continues to the south and north, and going up will take
you to the surface. Some blind lake fish swim about here, shying away from your
light as you approach. There is a slight current here pulling you to the north,
and you notice the lake water warms slightly to the south.

mostly blind, that shy away from your painfully bright light. There is a slow
current here, pulling you to the west. You can go north and west to other parts
of the lake, up to the lake surface and you can just make out a dark hole to
the south as well. You notice the fish and other residents of the lake don't
seem to have much interest in entering this hole. There seems to be a flow of
warmer water from that direction, which might explain why the lake's relative
warmth.

An Underwater Cave~
    Perhaps coming in here wasn't such a good idea. The temperature of the
water in what has turned out to be a small underwater cave is a few degrees
warmer than the chillier water of the lake proper. Perhaps that is why some
rather large and nasty predators have taken this to be their home. Unlike the
lake bottom, the underwater cave is rocky, and along the floor you can make
out a layer of bones whose depth isn't easily determinable. There is a crack
in the south wall out of which the warmer water flows, but it is too small for
passage. If you survive, you can exit to the north.

that lies further up the rocky shore to the west. There are a few signs that
others have stood where you are now - a bit of broken bone here and a scrap of
metal there. Perhaps this lake is used as a source of water for someone. The
tunnel to the west beckons invitingly to satisfy your curiousity.

    You have been swept along into what is apparently an underground stream.
Back to the west you can see the two sources of the stream, a large hole on the
one side out of which icy water shoots at terrific speed and a smaller crack on
the other side out of which warmer water is emitted more slowly. You could
probably get into the smaller crack, but the force of the current out of the
larger makes travel through it impossible. The current is pulling you to the
east, where the stream twists down and narrows.

The wind is very strong here, and it is cold. You make every effort to stay
next to the face of the cliff from which you emerged, as even with your
flying ability you would be buffeted by the winds to destinations unplanned
if you were to move away from it. You can see a small stream running into a
wide crevice in the rock down to the east, and above you to the west is a
smaller hole in the cliff face.

it is flat and smooth, shooting straight through the mountain's heart.

Ancient Road Under the Mountain~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The air is musty here, like one would expect from an area that
has not been traveled in ages untold. The road continues to the north and south
as far as your light can tell you. You sense the oppressive weight of millions
of tons of rocks hanging over your head, and marvel again at those who made
this road so long ago.

Ancient Road Under the Mountain~
    Abruptly, the road ends here in a tremendous cave-in to the south. It isn't
clear how long ago the earth shifted and the roof of the tunnel collapsed, but
it is clear that no further travel to the south is possible this way. You spot
a few bones and pieces of broken equipment here, and the shadows your light
casts off the large stones among those that block your passage seem to dance
and flicker evilly. You have a strong urge to flee.

Ambush!~
    Well, you've found an explanation for the broken bones. A party of
well armed troglodytes have marked your travel down the road and have been
waiting patiently for you to arrive. They seem to have come from a small hole
in the west wall you hadn't noticed before, as it was partially hidden by one
of the large rocks that has fallen from the ceiling.

about the dirty floor, personal things of the cave's occupant - a large and
particularly evil looking troglodyte. The conditions he is living in are
pitiful, and you turn your nose in disgust at the remains of a rotted tunnel
rat that he discards as you enter. Looks like he's found a more appetizing

this region. In fact, from the sounds and glimpses to movement you see to the
west, you might have stumbled upon a troglodtye settlement. There are several
large troglodyes here will be glad to show you around. Well, they might be
willing to at least carry bits of you around, after they're done taking you

it is adolescent troglodytes that live here. There are pieces of broken bone
and little bits of metal and glass scattered about the floor, as well as the

dried blood from the less successful of those tutored here. Apparently they
play-fight awfully rough. The broken weapons and scraps of armor lying about
testify to this fact as well. There are exits to the south and west.

    Mmm, you can smell some delicious tunnel rat stewing here, a cave that is
quite apparently the cooking area for the troglodytes living around here.
There are a few pots and pans here, though they are barely recognizable as
such. The small fire under the pot from which that yummy rat smell is being
emitted is barely enough to see by, but you can detect some troglodyte matrons
slaving over the cookery. They seem to think you'd make a nice addition to the
meal they're preparing. There is an exit to the south, and you hear what might
be the clatter of weapons coming from the east.

you'd have to think the troglodyte people were constantly under attack. Who
could be invading their homeland? You realize it's probably adventurers like
you they guard themselves against. The cave is large and has three exits, one
each to the north, south, and east. There is a funny, slightly unpleasant smell
coming from the north.

    This is the entrance of a large cave, that extends to the west and then
branches out further to the north. It is likely that you have found the
beginning of the main troglodyte community, as they are quite numerous here.
>From their reaction to you, you'd think they are of the opinion you are
invading their privacy or something. There are two exits - east back into the
tunnels, and west, deeper into the caves.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    You are in the southeasternmost arc of a large cave shaped approximately
like a donut, with an extremely large column in the center of the cavern. The
diameter of the column, you estimate, is probably about two-thirds of that of
the cave itself. It makes for a very strange tunnel-like effect, but it looks
natural though you have no idea what force of nature might have caused it.
This is where the troglodytes hone their weapons and repair their armor. From
the looks of things, it appears as if it's a skill they've been working on for
some time; though their tools are limited their armor and weapons are in
excellent shape. Maybe the Repair Guy had some troglodyte blood, who knows?
As you enter the cave, the many troglodytes working in here eye your armor and
weapons appreciatively.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    This is the northeastern cave of a linked set of four caves, which could
also be characterized as a single cave with an awfully big column in the
center.  From what you can tell, the cave is shaped more or less like a big
donut. In this section of the cave, female troglodytes are working on
extracting those vital vitamins and minerals from recent kills, by crushing
the bones into a powder which gets mixed into an occasional meal. There are
a couple of young trogs running around here, annoying those working. All this
activity ceases when you enter, and they turn to the task of defending their
home. In addition to the exits along the cave to the west and south, there is
also a passage leading north.

    This cave appears to the the nursury. Normally, the troglodyte young and
their guardians are here, playing games and learning new skills. The cave is
entirely unlit normally, and the presence of your light source appears to be
the brightest thing some of the little trogs have ever seen. Again, it strikes
you that you might be trespassing. There is a larger cave off to the south,
and there are also cavern to the north and west.

would be occupied by troglodytes watching over the other strongpoint to the
east, preparing to reinforce them in case of any trouble.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    You are in the female troglodytes sleeping quarters - as nice a place as
you think you've ever seen, for a cave. It looks like the place has been
cleaned with a toothbrush... even the dirt on the cave floor looks clean. The
rocks are shiny and sparkle at you, hinting at worth in their glittering
cleanliness, even though you know they are without value. There are ordinarily
several female troglodytes here, in serious discussion.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    This large cave is the sleeping quarters of most of the male troglodytes,
a fact that is evinced more than anything by the bad smell and the large mess.
How so many creatures who don't believe in bathing could live together in one
room is beyond comprehension. Perhaps troglodyes have no sense of smell. This
place is such a mess, you imagine they must have bad vision, too, to tolerate
it. The cave is normally occupied by a few troglodyte soldiers, catching a nap
between guard duties.

    The cave you are in resembles a tunnel more than anything, and might be
labeled as such if it weren't so wide. In fact, though, you are in a cavern
with an extremely large column of natural stone in the middle, which blocks
the view of the other side of the cavern from your current position. This part
of the cave is a practice area for adult troglodytes, as there are scraps of
metal and wood scattered about the floor in silent testimony to past rites of
supremacy that determine the clan chief. There are exits to the north, south,
and east.

    You are now in the northwest arc of a large, donut shaped cave. This is
likely the place where the soldiers work out ther strategy and formations, as
you can see a bunch of rocks set on a stone "table" (really just a large, flat
rock), ostensibly the staging grounds for mock battles and strategic plots by
troglodytes here for many a year, given how smooth the top has now been worn.
There are also several crude drawings on the wall, though what they are of, it
is hard to say for sure. The cave continues to the south and east, and there
are also passageways leading to the west and north.

    This is the chief's "private" cave. Apparently being the leader of these
people has some priveledges, at least. The caves furnishings are only slightly
more ornate here than anywhere else, though, so apparently the job isn't
exactly loaded with perks. The chief is here, talking with his top fighters
about prospects of battle. They turn to you, knowing now the battle they had
been anticipating is already upon them. There is an exit to the south.

    This cave is apparently the place where the troglodyte chief receives his
guests. There is a large case filled with trophies from past victories of the
troglodyte clan. Among the trophies, you spot a battered Golden Shield, the
skull of a cave fisher, with some dents and a big hole just over the right
eye, a small crystal sphere, and dull grey helmet with a plume that was once
probably white. The mementos here range from the unexpected to the astounding.

Mountain Trail~
    The end of the mountain trail is evident to your west from here; the trail
drops steeply and the ground turns greener, as the elevation isn't sufficient
to maintain the ice and snow of the higher ground. A freezing wind blows down
the mountains through which this trail winds, and it makes you shiver in your
boots. The mountain trail leads to the south from here up and up again the
mountain heights. You can also go west to more moderate climes.

    The trail turns again here, as it makes its way up and around the peaks
the have started to appear around you in all directions. Though the path
doesn't assault any actual peaks, you notice that the elevation here is
significantly higher than it is to the north, and it rises even further as it
continues it's journey to the east, since it moves of the valley floor up
along the side of a mountain. Up until now, the snow that has been adorning
the mountains was higher up, but you have come to the point where the trail
winds through the snow. Still, it is compact enough to permit travel, though
the way is a bit slipperier.

    It is bitterly cold here. The snow on the path is about ankle deep here,
and it's fresh, which makes traveling on it a bit of a trial. The path is now
making its way along a mountainside, rather than trying to slither between the
peaks at their bases. As a result, to the south there is an impressive drop to
the valley floor far below. Fortunately, the path is wide enough to afford
easy travel without worrying about slipping to one's death below. The grade is
quite steep going up to the east, though to the west the trail leaves the
mountainside on it's way down to warmer places. An icy wind blows from the
southeast, chilling you to the bone.

    The trail curves along the side of a mountain here, leading to the west

below you, you can see lesser peaks to the north. You are above them, and you
can see they are just below the constant cloudline that glooms menacingly on
the trail leading south into the mountains above you. The snow is still
shallow enough here for reasonable travel, though it is fresh, and your feet
sink into up to the top of your ankles. Unfortunately, it looks as if it only
gets deeper to the south, where the trail rises further. The wind is strong
here, and it claws at your clothing, penetrating it to make you long for warmer
climes.

Mountain Trail~
    Your ears pop, and it is difficult to breathe normally here, as the
elevation makes for a scarcity of oxygen in the atmosphere. You hope to leave
this place soon, as the elements are starting to wear on you. It is snowing
lightly here, and the fresh snow on the ground makes travel difficult, as each
step is a labor in which you submerge your feet into the knee deep snow and
extract them again to plod on. Adding to the unpleasantness is a wind that you
are really starting to resent, blowing down from the the south. Visibility is
restricted here by the cloud cover, so it is impossible to tell how much
further the trail rises before it breaks through the worst part of mountains.
You can go up to the south, or down to the north.

    The trail drops into a small crevice here, as it makes it's way up the
side of yet another immense peak. You can't tell how far up you are for sure,
but given the practically waist deep snow and the difficulty you are having
breathing, it is higher then humanoids were built to travel for very long. The
nice thing about the crevice is that it prevents the wind from doing further
damage to you, for a while at least. The snow here is on the heavy side; large
flakes now fall around you silently. The crevice turns to the east, leading
ever upward, and to the north it returns to the lands below.

    To say it is snowing here would be an understatement. It is snowing
*hard*, and combined with the strong cold wind the weather here could almost
be characterized as a blizzard. You have to bend over to present as little
surface as possible to the constant force of the wind. The mountain trail is
now covered in hip deep snow and distinguishable only because the mountains to
the north and east and southwest prevent passage in those directions. You can
barely breath, and the instant crystalization of what little air you expel
tells you that continued travel here may be a fatal mistake. To the extent the
trail is visible, it leads to down the mountain to the west and up further
still to the south.

    You are in a full force blizzard, travelling along a narrow pass near the
top of the peaks in a vast mountain range. You can just see the outlines of
the pinnacles of the mountains to your east and west, and the ground seems to
have entirely flattened out, though it is hard to be sure with the gale force
wind buffeting you about and blowing snow in your eyes. It is nearly
impossible to breathe here, the air is so thin. You are now practically
swimming in snow, and the exertion is exhausting you. The mountain path leads
further south, and to the north, where the trail descends.

Snowy Pass~
    The wind screams in your ears here, as you enter a narrow mountain pass
at the very apex of the mountain range. From what little you can tell in the
driving snow, the trail drops in elevation to the south, though it flattens
out to the north. Unfortunately, the further south you go, the deeper the snow
gets. Eventually, it reaches eye level, and you realize that further passage
in this direction is impossible. The prospects of making your way to the north
are not particularly attractive, but further travel to the south is right out,
since wading through snow above your head would certainly result in a frozen,
self-performed burial.

The gentle hills to the west become steeper to the east, which is the way the
trail continues, in addition to it's sojourn through the dryer valley to the
north. To the west you can just make out the outlines of rectangular object
of impressive size. Probably a city or something.

ending in a riverbed, as there is a cliff apparently blocking further passage
in that direction. The landscape here is dotted with brown brush and other dry
weather foliage, though as you look to the south things get a bit greener,
probably the result of runoff from an extensive mountain range that has become
visible to the southeast. From here, you can see the whitecaps standing starkly
against the clear sky. The trail to the south looks like it's headed that way,
as the trail has a pronounced rise in that direction. You can also go west to

you can see a path winding its way through a dry hilly valley. To the west,
the trail rises up a series of switchbacks up the face of the cliff.  The
river bed also continues to the north. It is very hot here.

traveled, but given the amount of the dust on the floor, it is clear that like
the road itself, it has been unused for ages. There are sconces in the walls
for torches, but none are there now - your light source provides the only
illumination. You can exit east to the ancient road, or west, where the tunnel
enters a larger area that once served as a common area.

that a natural cave was enlarged to create the space you currently occupy.
The ground is flat, and unadorned. Once upon a time, weary travelers pitched
their tents here to rest before continuing on to their destination. There are
no signs of recent use, however. There are openings in the walls of this room
in all four compass directions, though your light source isn't powerful enough

possibility of any natural cause for its formation. Little remains of the
stables themselves, as the wood that was used to separate the animals has
mostly rotted to dust. What remains is broken and useless for its original
purpose. There is only one exit from this room, which is through a passage to

    This area looks to have been a supply station for weary travelers. There

time, given the elaborate apparatus of metal gutters that lead to a small hole
in the southwestern corner of the room. No water flows there now. There are
also stone biers jutting out of the floor in four rows, upon which foodstuffs,
mount feed, and other supplies could have rested. Nothing remains of whatever
supplies were once kept here. There are two exits; back to the commons to the
north, and also through a small passage to the east.

for the supply area it is adjacent to. Like the supply center itself, however,

Distopian Street~
   The Street continues north and south.  The buildings here are in the
same condition as those you've seen already.  The unseen eyes continue to
follow you.  You can just make out the top of a large building to the

In Front of the Distopian Town Hall~
   You stand in front of the massive Distopian Town Hall.  The building is
decidedly out of place in so small a town.  Instead of wood, it is made of
fitted stone, iron bars cover the few windows.  As you stare at the
building, you realize that it is vaguely shaped like a skull.  The sense
of evil is greatest here.  The unseen eyes are no longer simply interested
in you, now you get the feeling that they actively hate you for prying
into Distopia's business.

farmland and sickly looking fields, to your west is a dark and forboding
forest, strange cries and shrieks echo from within it from time to time.

over with the next breeze.  No one appears to live in this part of town.

then end ubruptly in jagged spires.  Empty windows stare blankly out,
overlooking nothing.  It looks as if the entire structure was dropped down
the side of a cliff, and that says something for the structural integrity
of the castle.  To the east, large, blackened gates hang on rusty hinges,
spreading out to the north is a large underground forest.

monsters descending upon hapless towns and destroying armies sent against

end of the room.  It is constructed of some strange metal, it is
unaturally cold to the touch and is so black you have trouble making out
the edges of it.  Travka is not currently seated upon his throne, but
Anterror, the Captain of the Distopian Guard, is here and he looks
displeased that his guards have been unable to stop you from entering this
far into the castle.

A Cavern~
   This small cave must have broken open when the castle sunk into the
ground.  The sound of water is coming from a dark hole in the floor.  You
can re-enter the hallway to the south or you can venture down into the
cave.

Heavily Fortified Room~
   This is a very odd room.  The walls and ceiling are all made of metal
inscribed with runes of power.  The exit to the west has a huge metal door
set in the ceiling ready to slam down, and the only other exit is a large
metal door that is also inscribed with glowing runes.  The ladder going to
the door looks like it is made to withdraw into the floor.  This room
looks as if it was made to keep something from entering into the main part
of the castle.  You wonder what could possibly warrant such security.

Laboratory~
   This room is filled with strange devices.  Oddly glowing liquids run
from strange beaker to strange beaker, gets heated over a flame and then
runs through some more beakers and flasks.  Some of the tubing leads into
cages along the west wall.  You can see creatures from all over the land
in these cages, both mundane and magical.  Other tubing leads into large,
walk-in cages to the east.  The lighting in the cages is very poor, but
you can make out things shuffling about in them.  Small goblins dart
about, adding chemicals into the beakers and adjusting dials and knobs.
There is additional lab equipement to the north, and a door in the floor
leads to the rest of the castle.

inspection you see that they have small bits of writing declaring them as
building materials stolen from a construction site.  The floor is dirt and 
rock, mostly dirt.  A few small spider webs have formed in the corners and
a hole, that looks to be the right size for a mouse, has been made in the 
north wall.  This place really smells and you wouldn't mind leaving it as

sign~
You are at the entrance to Deadhame, an area designed for low

are well-trained not to attack players unless provoked.  As one 
goes downstairs, he is likely to encounter greater challenges than
he would on the first level, and he might even cross paths with one
of the bad-tempered monsters.  If you are 1-3rd level, you would be
well advised to adventure here as part of a group, or you will find
yourself overwhelmed.  If you are well over 8th level, you may find
the challenges here to be fading, and it is likely time for you to

A dark hallway~
   You stand in a dark passage that is man-made or troll-made or
something, but it is not natural in any way.  There are doors to the
north and south, made of some strange wood and stained by blood and
gore.  The hallway here runs both east and west.

the trail itself that was burning so brightly ahead.
Suddenly you stand face to face with a huge, flaming
efreet! You cringe in terror as you see two large gates
that seem to glowing with a faint aura of red.

   As you enter the room you see several weapons hung upon
the walls, just as you start to take some of the weaponry you
notice that is has long since rusted and is of no use to you.
At the far end of the room you notice a small table, a closer
look reveals the remains of what may have been a knight. The 
corpse, resting in a chair just behind the table appears to be
grasping something. Moving closer to the corpse you notice a
sword held tightly in the clutch on the skeletal figure, looking
at the sword you realize it is unlike the rest of the decayed
weaponry.... The blade appears to be razor sharp, and the metal
untarnished.

   As you begin to climb down the side of the pit, you begin to
lose your footing. Desperately you try to regain any hold you can,
but unfortunately you can not find any and you begin to fall! After
several minutes, you begin to wonder if there is any end to this
seemingly bottomless pit into which you have fallen. You wish you
could fly but your equipment is so heavy and gravity is bringing
you down too fast! Just as you wonder how to get out of this and 
decide that there must be no end and that you will fall eternally,
you notice a bed of very large steel spikes fast approaching you,
Alas there is no escape. You cry out in agony as the spikes pierce
your flesh!

throne of crystal, strange runes of gold are set into the throne.  Your
heart stops for a moment as you notice the decayed, skeletal form of a
lich seated in the throne, the red glow of its eyes fixed dead upon you.
With a quick motion of its hand, the door from which you entered,
magically forms into a stone wall. the only exit is an ornate door set
into the wall behind the throne of the lich! An evil laugh echoes

quest.  The quest to save the surrounding area of Narshe from the evil
that has so recently overcome it with the rising of the tower from the
inner earth.  This is the ground part of the tower, and a steady flow of
air passes through the slimy catacomb walls.  Disfigured human limbs reach
from the walls towards you, and you can hear a low, and faint moan from
the inner recesses of the hallways.  Suddenly, behind you, the two bone
doors slam shut, and lock.There is no turning back now...

Dark Rising~
   Swirls of sudden color and light orbit around you.  This area begins to come
bright as light enters the room.  Strands of light grow on the walls like vines
up a fence.  The light suddenly turns green as it starts its final formation of
illumination.  A large, dark clothed man begins to become visible...

The Final Battle~
   Wind enters this room suddenly with violent force!  The walls break away,
with it, crumbling apart before you.  Eventually, the entire tower is gone,
except for this rooms floor, making it hover in mid-air, miles above the
planets surface.  You know this is an illusion, but it seems so real, and
terrifying, you feel like screaming in fear.  The man you saw in the rising
raises his normally lowered head.  Sephiroth, master of the tower.  He stands
before you, and brandishes his godly blade, "The Masamune"!  "Welcome" he says
to you.  "I have been waiting for this moment, a very long time.  " he finishes
as he focuses upon you, and grins...

Peace At Last!~
   You strike the final blow to Sephiroth.  He falls, but catches himself with
his arm.  Slowly, he looks up at you, and closes his eyes tight.  A teardrop of
blood trickles down his cheek from his right eye.  Sephiroth slumps over onto
the ground finally, dead.  The Masamune is released from his grasp.  You step
over to his once powerful body, and watch as it disintegrates before your eyes
into a pile of dust.  Reaching into the pile, you pull out the Masamune and
hold it over your head in triumph.  You have saved the land of Narshe, and rid
an enemy of immense evil.  From this day on, you will be known as a true hero
in the eyes of the people of Narshe...

extremely hot and two channels on either side of the passage are filled
with flowing lava. A small set of steps leads up to a massive dais set in
an equally massive alcove.  Flames lick down from the dais.

The Altar of Fire~
   From the center dais here, a massive figure laden in spiked armor, a
flaming shield, and a morningstar with a head the size of a boulder rises.
Flames leap around him and his eyes are just glowing spheres of liquid
rock.  Hate fills the air, and following that, flames and lightning.  This
is the Mighty God of the Fire Giants!

faded beyond recognition.  This small foyer has a staircase leading up

Gnome War Encampment~
     You have just entered a clearing in the mushroom forest. All around
you, you can see small gnomes scurring here and there making preparation
for war. None of the mushrooms here have been cut down or harmed in
anyway the gnomes just move in and out of them. Some wounded gnomes lie
here on the forest, they are being prepared to be taken back to the
caverns.

Enchanted Mushrooms~
     You move forward through the beautiful mushrooms into an enchanting
area. You take a step up onto a small ledge. The mushrooms here seem to
be growing in patches. The patches are all vibrant colors, bright reds,
yellows, blues, and greens. Some of the mushrooms seem to sway slightly,
it must just be your imagination. A fine warm grey mist comes up to your
waist but it doesnt impair your vision.

An Intersection in the Seaweed Forest~

branch out in all directions. Never before have you encountered such an
unusual creation of Nature. Strong growths of seaweed take upon an almost
tree-like appearance. The ocean floor is not what you expected it to be like!
Your danger-sense is running rampant though as if perhaps there is a snake
in this veritable oceanic Eden.

Inner Gates~
     The gates here are heavily armored and look like they could stand
against almost any type of siege. As you look out onto the courtyard you
can see a shrine of some sorts.

Guest Tower Proper~
Alabaster and gold in a mosaic design form the walls and floor. The
furniture appears to be entirely out of teak and rosewood. However,
the huge bed catches your attention --- A poor adventurer like could
use a little nap! A huge picture window looks out onto the courtyard.
You can see an open-air (rather open-water) shrine dedicated to the
Goddess Umbrelee.

A beautiful glowing figure in the courtyard.

A barrow mound.~
  You are standing atop a barrow mound which is about 15 feet in 
diameter.  There is no vegetation inside the circle, strangely 
enough.  A low cumulous of swirling mist engulfs you from the 
knees down, making it look as though you are partially buried.

City limits of Ghenna.~
  You are standing inside the city limits of Ghenna.  Once a booming 
barter town, it is now a haven for the evil which it bred over long 
years under the rule of the hubristic Lord Suzerain.  In virtually 
every corner you see ruins of some sort or another intermingled with 
old, age-whitened bones from all manner of beasts. 
  Exits lead in all cardinal directions.

A fountain of tears.~
  A large fountain containing the tears of those slain within the 
city limits has been erected here, abutting the east wall of the 
city - it looks quite deep and wide.  The water is a crystaline blue 
which exudes holiness, something quite strange for such an evil city.
  Exits lead West, North and South.

The smell of death.~
  You are standing in what appears to be the town graveyard.  
Nobody feels the need to bury the dead, so the corpses are just 
strewn about in no particular order.  And the smell, oh boy!  
It's all you can do to keep from losing your lunch right now.  
  The corpses are stacked too high to exit East, but you can 
pass North, South or West.

  The incessant wailing of souls in torment causes visible shivers

blood-red mass that eludes description.  A rift in the ceiling above 
you causes a slight breeze to ruffle your hair.  A magic portal stands 
south, leading into the unknown.

looking bar to the north which seems to be moving somehow.  Next to 
the bar a stairwell disappears into blackness above.  The ceiling is 
vaulted, and sports three candeled chandeliers, which hang like 
victims above you.

ALIVE!

that werent bad enough, there are about a hundred horribly disfigured 
corpses laying here.  It looks as though the flesh was eaten off of 
their living bodies as they writhed in agony.  The stream of blood you 
witnessed at the entrance is much larger here, apparently you are onto

Lair entrance.~
  This is an arched cavern of great size - it looks like the Houston 
astrodome.  a great ledge of rock juts out above your head, showering 
you with a steady gush of blood and entrails.  A raucous sound of 
crunching viscera, intermingled with a slurp here and there, turns 
your stomach.  Then you hear it... an encouraging voice which keeps 
repeating "Yes, yes, thats it... just a few steps more...You're almost 
there."

everywhere.  At least you finally found the source of that horrific 
sulfur smell.  A black, steaming substance is smeared all over the 
walls emitting the funk.  As if this werent bad enough, you suddenly 
have the feeling that your life is about to end soon.

A cramped grotto.~
  You are in a cramped grotto over the cave entrance.  Even if you 
arent claustrophobic this place can surely make you that way.  A 
crawlspace leads West.  Watch your head.

  The grotto opens up into an adit big enough for you to stand 
upright.  Stalagmites and stalactites alike jut from the floor and 
ceiling.  There are exits East, North and West.

  You are in a crawlspace that is just barely passable.  There is a

Abode of the Efreeti.~
  You have entered the magical abode of the great Efreeti.  Done in 
an eastern motif, this room glimmers with all the amenities one could 
want.  Pillows, rugs and candelabra are everywhere.  This definitely 
looks like the lap of luxury.  To the North lies the forbidden treasure
room, to enter it is to ask for certain death.

  You have made a foolish mistake, my friend.  This is the Genie's 
equivalent of the forbidden fruit.  A giant hand emerges through a 
rift in time and squashes you flat, like a bug.

tricks on your eyes.  You can just barely make out a dark figure to 
the north.  There is absolutely no way you can return the way you 
came.  You can, however, exit towards the East, West, and North.

A long sloping tunnel.~
  You are in a long tunnel which slopes ever so slightly toward the 
South.  The smooth rock walls look like they are sweating - there is 
SO much moisture.

Tunnel's end.~
  The tunnel opens up into a T shape here, affording exits East and 
West and of course, North, back the way you came.  The cavern is 
vaulted, looming about 25 feet over your head... looks pretty dark up 
there.

  This tunnel is a little broader, and easier to maneuver in.  
However, you have become confused... which way is which?  There 
is a hole in the wall to the North, and another path leads South.

Towering before you is the Great Korban Forest, its trees are the largest 
in the known world.  It is rumored to be the resting place of Palmbarin Knor,
the mercenaries God of Vengence.  You are unnerved by the obvious lack of
one thing here....sound...this place is too quiet, the hairs on the back
of your neck bristle slightly as you become aware you are being watched.
There is a path leading to the west, its rather neatly trimmed entrance
tells you someone has been here, not too long ago.

You are at the edge of a oddly formed pool of pure white pebbles, perfectly
raked lines form graceful flowing patterns in the stones.  You are almost 
mesmerized as you ponder this odd creation.  Great pains were taken by 
someone to create this beautiful pebble pool, it must serve some purpose.
Ahead you see a small cabin, smoke is curling lazily from its chimney, 
perhaps someone there can explain this.

A few things here attract your attention, the cabin appears rather modern
with metal hinges and glass windows, not the rustic makeshift abode that
one would expect this far from civilization.  Its owner took great care
in its construction, a man of great pride and skill built this home.  
The door seems to be wide open, you wonder what is inside.

assortment of figures carved from wood.  A large table and a chest are the

You come upon a small clearing deep within the Korban forest, its obvious
from the smooth ground and fire pit, that this is a campsite.  Judging by
the still smouldering fire it has been used very recently. It appears the
occupants were in a great hurry to leave, as a few supplies and some food
were left behind.  You wonder what could have caused them to leave in such

silence.  The paths seem well-traveled, the undergrowth matted down and 
the foliage hacked away to leave plenty of room or a traveller to pass in 
every cardinal direction, excepting the west path seems fairly overgrown...
   You feel watched.

River's Edge~
   A beautiful river flows swiftly by, the current looking quite 
dangerous in fact.  Out in the center of the river you spot the energy 
barrier enclosure...no way out here.  Looking up, you see a bird fly 
right through the barrier overhead and wonder as to the force field's 
nature.  This path leads south into the forest, and westwards along the 
river's edge.

River's Edge~
   The river flows on its course, unhampered by the energy barrier 
passing right down its center for as far as you can see in both 
directions.  The path you are on travels along the length of the river to 
the east and west in between the water and the forest's edge.  Once again 
you shiver and feel that unmistakeable sense that you are being watched.  
 Disturbing.

River's Edge~
   A large out-cropping of rock blocks this path along the river to the 
west, and you don't spot any way around it; the woods are too thick to 
the south, the river too swift to the north, the magical barrier above 
you.  This is a nice area, however, as evidenced by the amount of traffic
this path gets.  From the marks in the grass, you guess that this is a 
favored resting spot.

Forest Trail~
   This well-used forest trail leads south.  Among the foot-tracks in the 
dirt, you spot a few animal tracks as well, leading you to believe that 
these trails are used by hunters.  Why would they be enclosed in this 
manner, however?  There is a clearing to the north, and the path continues 
to the south.

   This trail leads north-south...obviously a gaming trail.  The woods, 
mostly deciduous trees with the accompanying ground foilage, crowd in to 
either side.  A shrub to your left shows a fresh cutting wound...looks 
like a sharp object like a knife or machete did the damage.
   A crackle in the leaves spins you around, to see nothing.  Something 
is watching you, you feel it.  Where?

   The trail changes direction here, turning to the north and west.  A 
large tree to your south bears an interesting artifact; a rusty arrowhead 
embedded in the wood.  It looks as if the arrow had been  broken off at 
the head, the wood scratched at, and the arrowhead left behind.  
Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be much of interest in this particular 
section of the woods.

around here...it seems as if many have been cut down by some sort of crude

   Some small cages sit here, containing many different types of 
rodents.  Leaning down to look better, you are very surprised as a tiny, 
common garden mouse growls at you and tries to rip your face off through 
the bars.  There are some bulges on its back, and it doesn't seem to 
be in a very good mood.  It quivers some, not fully in control of its 
motor functions.  Poor thing.

The Cathedral Courtyard~
   Leaves blown about by the wind of countless centuries fill this 
lonely empty courtyard with their dull hollow rustle.  As you look
around an eerie feeling overcomes you, as if you are being watched.
   Just to the north, you see that the once beautiful double doors
leading into the cathedral proper have been torn from their frames
and left lying on the ground near the now open doorway.
   At the southern end of the courtyard, a large iron wrought gate
can be seen, creaking in the wind.  On the other side of the gate,
there seems to be an older road leading away from the cathedral.

The Cathedral Entrance~

see the once beautiful font and the once pristine spring from which
the holy waters were once drawn.  All that remains now is the result
of the desolation, despair, and destruction caused by whatever turned
this cathedral into the ruin it is now.  It seems as though everything
here has been corrupted and spoiled.
   There are small alcoves to both the east and west.  The cathedral
also continues northwards towards where the altar should be.  There
is a large open doorway to the south, leading out to the courtyard.

The Aisle Of Pews~
   As you move through the cathedral, you find yourself fighting your
way through the numerous overturned pews here.  Interspersed amongst
the pews are moldy remains of books.  Dust and decay covers everything
here, giving you the impression that nothing has been touched for years.

located somewhere to the north.

took their offerings.  But now only the decay of years remains.  Looking
around you spot what appears to be a stain on the ground and another on
the wall.  You also seem to hear louder wailings... or was it something
else?
   To the east and west, you can see what appear to be confessionals.

destruction where numerous pews have been strewn about.

thing is that the pews themselves seem to be of a much higher quality
than the ones to the south.  Perhaps this is where the nobles used to
worship.  Unfortunately, all has fallen into decay and neglect.

about, you notice that the beds are made and clean robes are hanging on
hooks by the heads of each one.  The beds are arranged so that the foot of
each is in the middle of the room, whilst the heads are in small alcove in
the wall.  There is a small chest at the foot of each, but a quick glance
reveals nothing out of the ordinary.
   The thing that strikes you most oddly about this room however, is that
there are no beds along the north wall, but there is a narrow door at the
east end of it.  A small curtain is located at the southern end of the room

Walking through DragonSpyre~
Within the realm of the DragonSpyres, everything seems different.  The wall
appear to reach out towards you, while the floor and ceiling struggle to crush
the life from you.  The further you proceed into the Mountain, the more you
wish you hadn't come here in the first place.

You are beginning to feel very unnerved.  Since you have been walking through
DragonSpyre, the screams had been slowly dying off, and now they are no more.
Normally the lack of death cries would be a welcome change, only now they
have been replaced by a very eerie silence.  You don't like this one bit.

You have reached a fork in the path through DragonSpyre.  You can't be sure
which way you should go, but the odd scraching sound to the east makes
you want to go west.  The giggling that has been following you around has
now become a full blown laugh.   "They are ONLY dragons."

You have managed, through luck(?), to find the lair of the white dragon.  It
stands before you, glaring at you with its pale blue eyes.  All around, the
walls are coated with a thick layer of ice.  You slip several times before 
gaining your balance enough to face the fearsome beast.  Will you fight it,
or flee?  "It is JUST a dragon."

Now, you are entitled to his treasure...if you can find it.
The hallway here is colder than the rest of the cave.  You assume that the
white dragon made frequent passes through here to make sure his gold
was still intact.  You begin to hope that it wasn't a baby....

the walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.
It feels like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on

It feels like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on

not be that long of a distance.

Within the bounds of this room, time has seemed to stop.  There is no	
movement, save for the large mass at the back of the room.  Out of the	
corner of you eye, you manage to catch a glimpse of a droplet of water
"falling" from a stalagtite...it appears to have been in the same position
for the past century.  You have no chance to move before the Dragon strikes.

All about you are the untold fortunes of many generations of families.
Nothing here seems to be touched by age, it is all in perfect condition.	It has remained as it was many years ago when it was taken.  Although the	Dragon and the original families considered these items "treasure", you	
manage to find little of value beside a pile of gold coins you collect.

to move slowly changing the layout of the room. As you examine the room

chained to. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Thier deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...

your surprise, the trail is very well kept, immaculately clean, and
strangest of all, quiet.   There are a few animals you catch glimpses of
from time to time, but few of them allow more than a faint hint of a tail
before diving into their burrow or hole.  The footprints disappear, but it

You smirk as you realize how crafty these little clean-freak buggers were,
hiding a trail in a guardian shrubbery.  As you glance around you, the
shrub laughs maniacally and closes the path behind you.  Many sets of
glowing white eyes peer at you from within the foliage from all sides. 
The eyes seem to be accompanied by shuffling feet through the underbrush,
all of which makes you extremely nervous.  You have no choice but to press

You squint and shade your eyes at the excruciatingly bright whiteness in
front of you.  As your eyes adjust to the level of light, you realize that
the massive gleaming object you see is a huge white city.  You see
movement of white robed figures along the walls and in front of the gates
of the citadel.  From this distance, it appears likely that the city 
dwellers are as fanatical about the purity and cleanliness of their city
as they are about 
its surroundings.

The gatehouse~
Before you stands a large open gate wrought of some strange white metal,
framed by two large guard houses, currently empty.  The walls of the city
tower at least 25 feet above your head.  Looking around, you see that this
is no small lost city in the woods.  It appears to be a thriving and
prosperous place.

Central square~
The inside of this city is incredible!  Whitewashed walls of stone and
immaculately cleaned streets that look like they have been washed on a
daily basis.  The central square is a virtual beehive of activities
ranging from simple peddlers and artisans to wealthy citizens conducting
affairs of city and state.  With whom, you wonder, are they conducting
business way out here in the woods?

Topping the stairs, you are astounded by the beauty and luxury of items
found in this room.  A sprawling carpet on the floor, wide feather-bed,
ornately carved desk with a matching chair, and even windows on all four
sides overlooking the magnificent city below.  This room has obviously
been lived in very recently.

You stand at the bottom of a long, marble, spiral staircase that leads
upward into the darkness of the tower above you.  You hear several
shuffling footsteps hurrying up the stairs.  Judging by the Spartan
accommodations, that whomever lives here may be involved with the white
robed figures who run the city.

A finer, more spacious room have you never seen!  Unfortunately, most of
the space would normally be taken up by comfortable furniture.  Only a
simple bed, chair, and table adorn this room.  Not even a window to

Entrance to the catacombs~
The complete darkness of the underground takes a moment for your eyes to
begin to adjust to the paucity of light.  You try to remain calm as you
hear many screams and groans which seem to echo at you from every
direction.  Above you, you can hear the shopkeeper walking on the
floor-boards.  Minimal light streams in from the trap-door back to the
white-washed city above.

Laid out before you is the most horrifying and disgusting array of torture
implements that you have ever seen.  Body parts of thousands of victims
lay strewn about the room like some form of grotesque confetti.  The blood
and gore covering the floor is at least 6 inches deep and treacherous to
walk on.  On several of the machines lay the violated bodies of many the
recent dead.  Your stomach lurches to your throat as you try not to

stone in the chamber below.  Crude seats are fashioned here from the
surrounding porous rock and the walls are decorated with various
bonesaws and a quote in blood, 'That fell arrest without bail.'  A
coffin lid door is set in the east wall, while steps cut into the rock
lead down and west.

Cold Storage~
   The stink of this storage chamber make you balk at once.  Through
your nausea you make out cadavers kept cool in niches in the stone
walls.  Barrels of dust and decanters of blood fill the room.  On the
wall, in some dark ink, is scrawled, 'That dreamless sleep.'  The
chamber exits south and up.

centered with a demon's skull.  Before the altar is a black iron

another knight, and also he had a moonstone.  Thank you, my

engraving~
Pilgrim,
     You have reached the final step on your way to enlightenment. 
In this last step you will be shown ultimate evil to your north,
and ultimate food to your south.  This is the land of the undead.

Both those whose goodness links them to the land, and those whose
evilness was rejected dead are here.  To have true spirituality
one must know both.  Once you have been strengthened and forge
through the evil, there is one final test before you prove
yourself equal to the Avatar himself.  You must endure the test
of time.

In the Middle of the camp~
As you arrive to what seems to be the middle of the camp you notice a large well
that seems to have been for many generations and used by many. There are also
several small fires here with meat roasting over them the smell of wild meat
cooking over the fire fills the air.

Locked away in crystal are the mantle and battle sword that Tempus once
bore in mortal life.  The mantle bears the Coat of Arms of the Emporers
Stepsons and is identical to the one above the fireplace.  Legend has it
that when Thieves World has its greatest need and evil once more stalks
its fair lands, that Tempus shall once more take up his mantle and sword 
and do battle with evil even unto his own death.

an eskimo from his girlfriend and almost dying.

By the Fortifications~
     The trail continues to run next to the moat and across from the
defenses of the fort.  The stakes forming the wooden palisade look well
tended and very sharp.  The embankments are steep and will severely hinder
any force that desires to assault this fort.

The Edge of a Cliff~
     The trail, moat, and other fortifications all end at the edge of a cliff.
Hundreds of feet below this point is a valley with a small river.  Across the
valley to the north are more mountainous regions.  The way down is
treacherous and seems almost impossible.  However, a small path that hugs
the cliff face can be seen several feet below.

East of the Gatehouse~
     A small trail runs just east of the gatehouse close to the edge of
the moat.  A horrible reek rises up from the moat and makes the air hard to
breath. The fort's steep embankments can be seen across the moat.  On top
of these embankments stand several rows of sharpened poles that form a
lisade encircling the fort on three sides.

Into a Dense Wood~
     The trail quickly narrows to a small animal path and passes into 
the trees.  Mostly composed of pine and other confers, the forest seems
quite normal.  The smell of smoke is present and seems to get stronger to
the east.  The trail, however, is hard to follow and seems to end here.

Welcome to the Capture the Flag Quest~
Welcome to the CTF quest. I've changed around the
code for this room, so now to see the instructions,
type "help instructions". Couldn't be any easier.

Graveyard Porch~
As you come out to the back lot you notice head stones from 
ancient graves all thrown about. the room holds the strong 
smell of rotting corpses and blood. From out here you can see 
the whole castle which looks erie old and dangerous. 
all of the windows you can see are broken and the 
old back gate is rotting you can see large holes in it.

Misty Path~
As you venture further into the yard a Grey swirling Erie
mist surrounds you, its tendrils creeping around your feet.
You notice several corpses standing there as if frozen 
in life though unmoved for thousands of years. The smell 
of rotting flesh is almost more then you can bear.

Graveyard Path~
The back wall of the yard is a solid vertical mass of granite.
The blocks are held firmly in place by the clever shaping, with 
no mortar. The path continues around the tombs to the north.

Sarcophagus Tomb~
You enter a small, stuffy room that houses the sarcophagus of 
the once-illustrious inhabitant of this imposing crypt.
The coffin stands upright against one wall, almost touching the low 
ceiling, its painted lid stuck open on sagging hinges. You shudder 
as you notice that there are long, fresh tracks on the dust-covered stone floor.

Graveyard Path~
As you arrive you glance over to the west to relieve the 
depressing view of the somber crypt.  In that direction, a small
creek etches a deep azure line through the dark landscape 
between low, thickly overgrown banks.

Graveyard Path~
Here a few of the perfectly fitted granite blocks of the yard have 
been chipped away flake by flake over the ages by persistent forces.  
Brownish mosses and powdery lichen have taken hold in the crannies, 
further weakening the stone.  The sharp bits of stone are 
scattered over the blunter pebbles of the path.

Graveyard Creek-Side Path~
The path leads you close to the crypt.  The gray-flecked rock has 
been ground to a smooth, dull surface.  To the southwest, the boundary 
walls extend up to the edge of a shallow creek, and to the southeast, 
the spires of a high gate can be seen.

Crypt Gate Entrance~
You pause inside the gates to survey the eerie scene.  
A magnificently crafted granite crypt to the north inspires
wonder and loathing.  The carvings on the facade are horrific,
detailing the onslaughts of the undead throughout the chaotic 
history of the world.Many thorny brambles growing among the 
tombstones deter you from leaving the paved route into the crypt.

Inside the crypt~
The entry foyer to this enormous granite crypt is stark,
adorned only with grisly friezes sculpted in low relief into
the walls.  Bands of bluish-green ahnver are inlaid into the 
stone in thin strips just below the ceiling throughout the 
entire structure, bathing the rooms in a subtle light.
A shadowy arch curves overhead to the north and leads deeper 
into the inner sanctum of the sepulcher.

Ancient Crypt Library ~
This room holds niches and chests filled with dusty tomes,
yellowing scrolls and brittle manuscripts.  The scrolls are
fastened with sealing wax and silk ribbons, while the 
volumes are bound in rare leathers.  Although fragile from 
the passage of time, the dry atmosphere of the tomb has 
preserved them.  The documents arouse your interest but the 
fear that they may contain evil spells and dangerous 
knowledge prompts you to leave them be.

Crypt Cave~
A smallish cavern domes out above you, the packed earthern
walls appear part natural and part artificial.  It is dimly
lit by the same fungus that infests the entire area.  But 
there are sights here that would be better left in total 
darkness, piles of bones, heaps of rotting flesh, and things
less recognizable, in diverse stages of decay.  The air is 
full of unseen comings and goings though you feel no earthly breeze.

Lesser Throne Room~
This high chamber is a madman's travesty of a throne room in 
purgatory. On a dais sits an eldritch throne inlaid with the 
ivory of human bones. The walls are carved with gut-wrenching 
scenes of sub-human figures dancing and gibbering with hellish 
glee under constellations you have never seen.  Behind the 
throne is a tapestry whose subject turns your stomach.

Crypt Dinning Hall~
This place has been the scene of many a revolting semblance
of a feast. You have trouble holding on to your insides as 
the horror of what transpired in here sinks in. A scattering
of chairs, benches and old broken tables tells of the
terrifying attempts of the sinister celebrants to mock and 
imitate the ways of their civilized and unsuspecting prey.

Dark Tunnels~
As you wander through these tunnels, the cold gets deeper 
and deeper, penetrating to your very soul. A glitter of something
set in the wall catches your eye for a moment before you realize
it is merely a reflection from ice crystals forming from the 
deepening cold.

Frozen Tunnels~
The condensation has turned to frost here, giving the walls
a pale sheen like the pallor of death.  Ice crunches under
your feet no matter how hard you try to move silently.
From time to time, ice cold drops of water fall from the ceiling
and manage, with great skill, to find their way down the back 
of your neck. You choke back a muttered curse at the biting cold.

Ice Cave~
This room is dominated by a giant slab of ice.  There is a
chill here that transcends the cold you felt elsewhere.
Piled in front of the ice slab are the remains of many a
grisly sacrifice.  Bones and skulls lie piled at the base of
the slab as though in homage to something.

Underground Chamber~
This underground chamber seems to be naturally formed,
perhaps from some tectonic movement or similar seismic
activity. The tunnel leading away however is obviously
recently dug and, it appears, somewhat hastily done.
The layout of this place is rounded, with a concave floor
in the middle.

Underground Chamber~
Darkness prevents a clear survey of this small niche, but you
feel a space above your head.  The floor begins a steep
incline rising up into the rock and a narrow fissure, possibly
wide enough to squeeze through, is barely visible along the wall.
You feel a cool dampness around your ankles.

The Killing Field~
This room is nothing like the rest of the rooms you have seen, 
the walls are covered in blood, gore, body parts and other
unspeakable things. The walls look bright red from the mass 
ammounts of blood. You also see four pikes with the head of
human's on them, and candles burning inside their mouth's which provides enough light for you to see all about. Whatever lies ahead
of here you know cant be good.

Zombie Lord's Throne Room~
As you enter this room you feel a great ammount of fear already from what you have just seen to the south. 
You notice that this room is MASSIVE. The ceiling seems to go on forever and you cant make out the top. 
The walls are hundreds of yards apart yet you know your indoors this room is the act of some kind of magic. 
As you glance around further you notice a large throne in the middle it is the size of ten tree's.
Sitting on the Throne you see the King of the Crypt.
