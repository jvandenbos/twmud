sanctuary cappen varra bard sys~
Cappen Varra~
Cappen stands here, with the knowledge which comes with great adventures.
~
  This minstral is known as "the only honest man in Sanctuary" He is slim
and wiry, with long dark hair and blue eyes, a romantic man attempting to
find his fortune without spending too much effort to maintain it. His
poetry and music are his greatest skills but his rapier is nothing to be
sneered at.
  The bard is a man of many adventures, and the tales he could tell you
of Sanctuary will surely be of use to you.

Arman the Hell Hound~
Arman the Hell Hound is here.
~
Arman is slim and wiry, with the distinctive Raken nose he likes to look
down. As a Hell Hound, he is sort of a policeman whose prisoners often die
'trying to escape', or are injured 'resisting arest'. He follows Zalbar's
orders with a calculated insolence just short of insubordination.

Bourne the Hell Hound~
Bourne the Hell Hound is here.
~
Bourne is a large brown-haired man with a bushy beard and mustache; he is
one of the Hell Hounds but more ambitious to raise his social position
than the others. This has led into political intrigue, and he may be
considered of questionable charecter.

Hawkmask~
A Hawkmask is here.
~
These men and women wear blue hawkmasks when on business so that they
cannot be positively identified. They are members of Jubal's strongarm
crew of conscienceless mercenaries, responsible for much of his power in 
Sanctuary. They are well-paid, are the finest sellswords Jubal's money can
buy, and their morale is high. The average citizen (or even city guardsman)
steps aside when a hawkmask swaggers by.

Jubal is the black-skinned master of the criminal world of Sanctuary,
former slave and gladiator. He is master of almost any common weapon 
and a few that are not so common. Although almost fifty years old, he
still is a match for almost anyone in a fight and is willing to do his 
own dirty work if need be. One of the few blacks in Sanctuary, his
massive height and worldly bearing would set him apart in a similarly 
hued crowd.

A skinny man is trashing around hysterically.
~
This dude is in constant movement and surrounded by a white
fog. He coughs a little and utters 'Goood shit man'. Although
he's quite slim and doesn't look very intimidating, his wild
eyes tell you to back off. Wacko!

mriswith shape creature~
the Mriswith~
A mriswith is swinging his three-bladed knife fluidly.
~
The mriswith is a creature from a nightmare.
Its sinuous head looks part man, part lizard; covered in
a glossy, tight, black skin, smooth down to the base of
the thick neck where it welts up into pliable scales.
The lithe body, shaped much like a man's, seems made for
fluid speed, deadly quick grace.

Warren~
A mole-like man comes hesitantly out of the shadows.
~
This pale man is the young prophet Warren. His head of curly
blond hair is cut short at the sides. His hands are stuck in to
the opposite sleeves of his violet robes. Silver brocades circle
the cuffs and neck. He looks smaller than he is because of the
way he hunches over.

The Keepers minion - Gozgor
The air in front of the idol seems to waver, and a tall, skeletal
figure in a hooded black robe suddenly appears. It is grotesquely
misshapen and has a hideous face, eminating a green glow.

He is clad in dark military attire, strapped with weapons from
head to toe. His knuckles and boots are studded with glinting
metal, as is his ears and nose. His tangle of dark hair falls
around a bull neck, the size of your waist. Your stomach goes
queasy.

Jagang lord~
Jagang~
Jagang's wicked smile greets you.
~
The Dream Lord's bare shoulders bulge from a fur vest open
in the middle, displaying a few dozen gold and jeweled chains
lying against the hair in the deep cleft between his prodigious
chest muscles. His shaved head gleames in the fluttering
firelight. His neck looks like it belongs to a bull. A gold ring
in the flare of his left nostril holds a thin gold chain running
to another ring at midheight in his left ear. His eyes, though,
are what rivets anyone upon whom they settle. There is no
whites to them at all. They are a murky gray, clouded over
with sullen, dusky shapes that shift in a field of inky obscurity,
yet there is no doubt whatsoever as to when he is looking at
you. They are twin windows into nightmare.

Merissa~
A Sister of the Dark is here, serving the Keeper.
~
She carrys herself with confidence and slow grace. Her dark
hair and the fact that she's practicly naked, makes you
loose your guard and drop your jaw. The power of her
Han radiates, making her almost seem to glow. She doesn't
walk. She glides - like a swan, serene and cool. She is
the embodiment of pure, unadulterated lust.

The Sliph is here, ready to travel.

A lustrous metallic hump draws up into a bulk, rising
impossibly of its own accord, like water standing in the air,
only it isn't water. Its glossy surface reflects everything about
it, like polished armor, distorting the images reflected off its
surface as it grows and moves. It looks like living quicksilver.

A black, shadowy animal is lurching in the darkness.

Somehow you can't make out its shape. It's aproximately
your size, maybe bigger. Maybe a big rabbit, or a bear.. bears
can be black. As it reaches out you can make out the hands,
but they aren't hands. They are claws. Its shoulders start
shaking with laughter as it stares directly at you, with
golden glowing eyes. MAMMY!!!

Prelate Annalina~
An old woman, one of the cleaning staff, is standing on a stool, dusting a 
top
bookshelf.
~
She brushes a wisp of graying hair back from her face. Most of it
is drawn into a loose knot at the back of her head. Once she is
standing on the floor, the top of her head only comes up to the
lower tip of your breastbone. Her body is on the wide side, as
if she has once been taller, and a giant has put his hand on the
top of her head and squashed her down a good foot.

mistake one might make.

call him names, they never let poor Rudolph join any reindeer games.  But
after one foggy Christmas eve, he proved his worth, and is now Santa's favorite.

Everett the Evergreen grew up with just one dream.
To be somebody's Christmas tree.
He dreamt of children dancing 'round him,
Decorating branches on him.
His dream was quite a sight to see.
But when each Christmas came around and snow was everywhere,
He stood in the forest just as lonely as could be.
Nobody ever wanted him, and his branches were too bare,
And he thought he'd never be a Christmas tree.

This huge machine is clad in all black steel, not unlike the large
mechanical pump in the floor below.  It's head looks similar to a front
helm, with red light escaping from the eye slots.  It's large arms almost
reach as far down as it's feet do.  It walks with a slow pace, you could
easily outrun it if need be, but in a battle, it looks like it could
easily walk away as the victor.

eyes. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from it, which makes it an 
ominous and fearsome sight. Despite the wasted, rotten flesh it is garbed
in the rich clothes of nobility.

protrusions, like some strange malignant blemishes. It emits low, guttural
mewling from its fanged, quivering orifice.

Hmmm... seems that you have managed to walk in on Wyrenthoth during one
of his... its preening sessions.  You don't exactly understand what there
is to see beyond the bones.  Oh, wait, you didn't even know what the
thing in front of you was did you?  Well, you take the time to look, for
once, and notice that it is a large collection of bones.  And it just so
happens that this large collection of bones serves to form what looks to
be a dragon, although the odd bone or two seems to be out of place.  It
does appear that Wyrenthoth is a dracolich.

The hermit~
A Hermit, starved for company, is here.
~
Although raving mad, the hermit has come out of his isolation since he
has not spoken with anyone for ages.  The shaggy hermit draws you over
and tells you a tale:

	Some 600 years ago, when I was but a lad, a great dragon
	ruled the land.  His name was Ancalador.  Many heroes came
	to do battle with him, but all failed and died, horribly,
	I imagine.  But one wizard challenged the Drake to a magic
	duel.  He too died, like the others, but with his last
	breath, the wizard turned the mighty Ancalador to stone!
	Many believed the dragon's evil reign ended, but after the
	dancing and drinking were over, and life returned to its
	quiet pace, the people began to notice that the Dragon's
	presence could still be felt.  Ancalador did, in fact,
	continue to rule from his petrified prison through the 
	manipulation of the minds of men.  Indeed, he has done so
	to this day.  Many believe he is plotting the day he can
	return in the flesh, so to speak...

With that the Hermit begins to cackle madly, tears running down his
leathery face.  You can get no more out of him.
