Temujin's Space~
There is a peacefulness about this tiny cave that is unexplainable.  The walls
are sparsley decorated with crude, even childlike, caligraphy and glyphs.  Small,
valuless statues and figurines adorn the wimdow ledges and little chachke
shelves.  There is a quaint meditation rug in the center of the room.  Little
bits of notepaper and origame mobs surround the area around the little candle
adorned shrine that rests in front of the rug.  The scents of Sattya-Sai-Babba
incense, Sage, Padmini Dhoop, Frankinsence, Muir, and numerous other aromatics
fill the air.  The room is illuminated from everywhere and nowhere through its
semi-transparent crystalline walls.
