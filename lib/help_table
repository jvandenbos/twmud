"AC" "ARMOR CLASS"

  Your AC represents your armor class and determines how successful an opponent 
will be in hitting you.

  AC is roughly defined as follows:

      20 A naked person.
       0 A fashionably dressed person (eg: plate mail, shield, etc).
     -50 An armored tank.
    -100 An impenetrable fortress!

"AC_AFFECT" "ARMOR"
 
  AC-AFFECT or ARMOR changes your ac by the affected value no matter where it
is worn. Negative values have a positive affect on your AC. Positive values 
have a negative affect.
 
See also: AC, AC_APPLY

#
"AC_APPLY"

  AC-APPLY affects your AC differently based on where you wear the item. Each 
body location has a different multiplier. Body is 3, head is 2, arms are 1, 
etc. Some locations like wrist are 0. An example. suppose you have a piece of 
equipment with ac-apply 10 that can be worn on body, head or wrist. Worn on 
your body would give you a benefit of 30 ac. Worn on your head would give you 
a benefit of 20 ac. Worn on your wrist would give you no benefit whatsoever. 
AC-APPLY of an object also attributes somewhat to how difficult that object is
to scrap.

body at the current time.

#
"AFK"

  The afk command will set you as being Away From the Keyboard. What this means
is that you will get the (afk) tag on the who list, and when someone trys to 
tell/whisper/ask to you, the message will be sent, but the sender will also be

#
"ALIAS" "UNALIAS"
 
  These commands are for creating/removing aliases.  You can have a maximum of 
20, and they are stored WHEN YOU RENT.

For example:
  alias km kill monster
  alias gc get all corpse
 
  For then on, when you type km it will execute the command kill monster, and 
gc will execute the command get all corpse... kind of like macros. Be careful
however, as some command shortcuts may no longer work due to aliases using the
same lettering (ie. "gc" is the abreviation used to talk on a clan channel, if 
you created an alias using the same letters, "gc", then you would now have to 
use "gco" to communicate on the clan channel.).
 
  To remove an alias just type unalias (alias).

For example:
  unalias km
  unalias gc
will get rid of the two aliases listed above, making room for more (since you 
can only have a maximum of 20).
 
  To get a plain listing of your aliases, just type
alias(enter/return).

#
"ALIGNMENT"
 
  When doing the SCORE command, if your alignment is negative, this means you 
are evil, and positive alignment means you are good. Neutral alignment is any 
alignment between -350 and +350. Some objects in the game are aligned one way 
or another meaning you can not use them if you are of the improper alignment.

"ANIMATE DEAD"

Type:   cleric
Level:  11
Mana:   10
Syntax: cas 'animate' <corpse name>

  While researching resurrection techniques, a sect of clerics discovered that
while it was not always possible to bring back the souls of the once living, it
was possible to animate the bodies left behind. Upon doing so, the gods shunned
the sect, and any who followed in their ways for committing such an unholy act.

  Cleric guild masters still teach their followers this technique, if only so 
that they will not stumble upon it in the same way as the sect. Through the 
years they have also found that those who were more evil in nature created more
powerful zombies.

follower will remain loyal for as long as the caster maintains the spell's mana
consumption (see LEECH).

*note* If an optional name is specified, the caster will summon that named 
       servant rather than one proportinal to his level.

Servants available are (by level):

of your area of expertise, you can't understand it at all. This is an extremely
time consuming ordeal and is by no means completely accurate.

#
"ASSIST"

  If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same person the 
<player> is.

  ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting. It is 
better than KILL in many cases because you do not have to choose between 
1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered the room). Even though 
monsters of the same type assist each other in combat, ASSIST is better because
you will eliminate one aggressor much faster.

and effort. Through extensive research and prayer, a few different types of 
auras have been developed. More are currently being researched and developed 
for later use. Here is a quick description of each:

                    may cause some items to combust.
  Ice Aura -        Causes the temperature around the paladin to fall sharply.

  Lightning Aura -  Causes the air around the paladin to burst with 
                    electricity.

voice for songs of inspiration for companions and to instill fear in the
enemies. The Bard is an entertainer and a historian. They traveled greatly
and had to be able to survive the wilds alone which gives reason for
Druidic training.

   The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another
monster.  The only way to get a breath weapon is to either be a
monster with such an ability (dragons usually have one) or quaff a
potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/lightning breath.

  If you are already fighting, breath without any arguments will
breath on the monster you are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you
must supply the name of a target to breath on.

  Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before
you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders
with the same breath.

  This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will
always hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group,
followers and his leader.  You will also probably blast anyone
currently hitting on you.  You also have a small chance (less than
half) of hitting each bystander (someone not covered above).  They
will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat the snot out
of you.

  When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can breath ONE
time.  If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode
inside you causing half of its normal damage.  These potions also
reduce your CON for the duration of the spell.  You therefore cannot
quaff more breath weapon levels than you have constitution.  You also
cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you have levels.

  The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level, your
level, and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath
weapon's level it will do your hitpoints worth of damage to the
target.  If your level is double the level of the breath weapon it
will only do half your hitpoints of damage.  Monsters natural breath
weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level monster can
do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this
can be a LOT of damage.  Do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

"SAMPLE"

Type:   Shifter skill
Level:  30
Mana:   100
Syntax: sample <corpse>

Recently, Master Shapeshifter Gornn spent some time with the renowned
Ranger Cyric to study their skill of rationing.  Adapting this very tricky
and involved skill to his methods, Gornn was able to develop the ability to
store the necessary "genetic" information for shifting into round wafers.

This skill allows the shifter to take a light sample of a corpse to keep.
Later on, the shifter can opt to shift into a sample instead of a corpse,
and thereby giving shifters the versatility that they have long been looking
for.  Shifters must thank Gornn for this precious gift.

Due to the intense concentration of this skill, it takes lots of time for
the shifter to complete this skill, even when failing.

#
"STAT"

Type:   Gives all statistics of a player/mob/obj
Level:  Immortals Only!
Syntax: stat <obj/pc/mob>

   If you are interested in a person and want to find out about
his/her/its skills, strength, mana, hitpoints etc. In addition, 'stat
room' will give you useful information about the room you are in.

#
"ORDER"

   Order allows you to command your followers to do things.
ie: order giant hit Sisyphus

   However, if the subject is not under your control (ie: your charm
over them has worn off), they will give you an indifferent look :)

   To have all your followers do something type: order followers <action>

   "order <follower> guard [on|off]" tells your followers to pounce on
   anyone and everyone attacking you.

*note* Most of the followers which you are likely to aquire are not
       equiped to see in the dark. If you give them an order at night
       make sure they either have a light to see by or are bespelled
       to see at night.

#
"REMOVE"

#
"SHOPS"

   Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for
his quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to
survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse
to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!

   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of
trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect
is death in the end.  (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and
can shoot through schools).

"WARRIOR" "FIGHTER"

   Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.
This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills
of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.
However, they lack the ability to use magic of any sort. You can
improve your skills by using the practice command, in the room of the
swordspeople's guild with the guildmaster (usually the last room)

See also: BASH, KICK, DODGE, BERSERK, DUAL WIELD, RESCUE

#
"THIEF"

   Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other
class offers.  Many of these qualities can come in handy in many
situations, such as picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented,
however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself.
The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead,
avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying
items at the black market. You can improve you skills by using the
practice command.

   Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve (GAIN).  If you
type practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how
good you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practise a certain
amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to use this, it
can be accumulated.

*note* If you are not in the same room with your gm, you may use the
       command in the following format "prac <class name>" to get a
       listing of spells/skills of a particular class.

depend on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the
shops, for example.

#
"QUIT"

   When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing
'quit'. Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is
simply left on the ground. If you wish to have your equipment put away
until you are able to come back, you will have to find an inn and rent
a room.

See also: INN

#
"INNS"
   Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the
innkeeper looks after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you
may use inns to store your gathered equipment while you are not
playing the game (we all have to sleep sometimes, there is no shame in
that).

See also: OFFER, RENT, CHECKIN

#
"GET" "TAKE"

   If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get'
to pick it up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if
you just feel very greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use

#
"REST" "SIT" "SLEEPING" "STAND" "WAKE"

   For changing your position. If you feel weary, It is probably a
good idea to sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.

why not simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you
are following someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you
have to do is follow yourself: "follow <your name>".

   Shadow does the same thing, but doesn't inform the person you're following
that you've started following them.  This can be especially useful used
in conjuction with sneak.

troubles and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded so
that only members may enter the building. Guilds are also the places
where people come to learn and practice the skills of their trade. As
your increase in powers your local guildmaster will not be able to

See Also: GROUP, RESTRICTIONS, LEVELS

#
"GROUP"

Syntax: group <player>

   A group is a collection of players that share experience for killing
mobs.  For a group member to get experience for killing a mob, they must
be in the same room as the mob when the killing blow is struck.  Below
is an example of how to form a group.

     Example : Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

     Quifael : "follow dragon"
     Redferne: "follow dragon"
     Dragon  : "group dragon"
     Dragon  : "group redferne"
     Dragon  : "group quifael"

   Group with no arguments will show a list of people with whom you are
grouped.
   Since experience is divided up among the members of a group, if at any 
time the group leader wishes for one of the group members to not receive 
experience from kills, they can "group <player's name>".  While that player
will still be following the group leader, they will no longer recieve
experience from kills.
   If the group member no longer wishes for a member to follow them, they
can use the "lose <player's name>" command to make that person not follow
them any longer.

See Also: EXPERIENCE, LEVELS, LOSE, GROUP SPELLS, ORDER

#

#
"ROD" "STAFF" "STAVES" "USE" "WANDS"

Syntax: use <staff>
        use <wand> <target>

   Using staves will automatically target everybody (or everything) in
a room, in some cases, or everyone not in your group in others.
Therefore staves are naturally very powerful, and yet may be very
dangerous to use around other players.

   Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be
either a character or an object.

   Both staves and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use
the grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the
staff or wand to avoid confusion.

their proper values.

#
"LINK"

   A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

I.  If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

#
"DEAFEN"
   Type deafen and all shouts and player death messages and other
mortal channels are no longer heard.
   Type deafen once again and shouts and player death messages can
once again be heard.

the one that is edited.  You can edit any room, but the changes will
not be permanent.  However, using the rsave, and rload commands, you
can save your changes into a file, and reload them later into the
game, (if it crashes, for example).

NOTE: If you are confused by this, and try it anyway, you may crash
    the game.  Please be very sure that you know what you are doing.
    Also, try to avoid making too many changes to the existent areas
    for the moment.

   Also note: You need to have an area, before you start editing it.

"DOORFLAGS"
Syntax: edit ex <dir> <doorflags> <key> <to_room>

  Doorflags are the sum of:
  EX_ISDOOR		1
  EX_SECRET		8

12 0 which is NO_MOB 4 + INDOORS 8 = 12


   DARK           1 /* sorta obvious ain't ? */
   DEATH          2 /* Makes the room a DT */

Level:  Immortals Only!
Syntax: Make <short description>

  This creates a generic item with the given short description.  The
item has no special flags or attributes.  

#
"MULTI" "MULTI-CLASS"
 
   Some adventurers are so diverse that they have multiple "classes",
enabling them to a wide range of skills and spells.  However, due to
this diversification, they are not able to learn as quickly, and they
are never able to become masters in any one area.  The following table
demonstrates their limitations:

  # of classes	|	exp is divided by	max level
=================================================================
      1		|	       1		   125
      2         |	       3	 	   125
      3		|      	       5		   125

   Multi-class characters also learn practices at a slower rate, for each
level they obtain, they only learn the amount of practices a normal adventurer
would obtain divided by their number of classes.
 
   Multi-class characters may chose which class they go up in first, however, 
they earn a share of experience equivalent to the average of their levels.

   Another disadvantage is that multi-class characters have slightly lower
hit-points.

   Multi-class characters may not use any of the dms.

   Multi-class characters gain experience as regular charactes, in the sense
that there is only one value that stores experience, which is reduced when
gaining a level.  Keeping this in mind, one should read the "Experience
Needed to Gain" field as the amount of experience needed to gain in that single
class, not to be read as the amount of experience needed to gain in all those
classes.  E.g.:  A Mage/Cleric needs 4000/3000.  This Mage/Cleric decides
that he would like his next level to be mage, that would mean that he would
need 4000 experience to gain a single level in Mage, which means the
equivalent of 12000 exp of others (due to exp factor).  Likewise, in order
to level in both, he would need 7000 (4000+3000) and hence the equivalent
of 21000 exp of an equivalent single-classed character.

Note: Multi-class can be very useful for those wishing to have access
to both magic-user and cleric spells, or those wishing to have access
to other class's skills.

#
"REIMB"

   From now on, do not expect to get back game items, when you need a
reimb.  We have gone to alot of trouble to create special items called
reimb items!!  These items are balanced for character level.  So, a
lvl 3 player wont get as many items as a lvl 45 player.  Also, these
items are designed to give the appropriate bonuses at the proper
levels.  These items are to help the naked character get a good start
on recovering his equipment.  When you need a reimb ask a god and they
will create items and put them in your inventory immediately.  BEWARE,
these items have NO take flag.  This means when you drop these items
or put them in something, you will not be able to get at them again.
The reason for this: we dont want players just using reimb items as
regular armor. The rent on these items is fairly cheap.  These items
are not designed as regular game items!!!  So, dont ask a god to reimb
a lost reimb item.  Once you start aquiring regular game items, you
should get rid of the reimb items, after all, you dont need them
anymore.  HINT: it is best to keep these item equipped until you are
ready to replace the item with a regular piece of armor :) This is the
std policy on reimb for this posting forward.  SO DONT WHINE, just
accept it.  These items are very fair! I will listen to comments on
how to alter the various items.  Positive feedback is always
appreciated.

   If you die with any reimb items, you wont be able to get them from
your corpse.There are 2 solutions 1) DONT DIE until you have replaced
most of the reimb armor. 2) Ask a god for a new set of reimb armor
after you die.  This way the gods can keep an eye out for suicide
characters.

#
"NAME"
Syntax:  name [<new name>]

   Allows a player to set their short, or action name.  The general
effect of this is that rather than seeing Dork does such and such,
everybody will can see The big Dork does such and such.  It's
primarily intended to prefix a title to your name.

   However, you can use "~N" as a place holder for your short name if you 
would like to append something to the end of your name.  If it isn't 
present, it will be appended to whatever you did specify.  You can also use 
"~N" by itself to remove all appendages to your short name.

   Typing "name" with no arguments displays your current short name.

   Examples:
    Command:                    Output:
     name                        Dork
     name ~N                     Dork
     name The big                The big Dork

Mana;   30
Syntax: cas 'res' <corpse name>

   This spell may be used on a player or monster. When the recipient
of the spell drops to a CON of 3 they may be resurrected no more.

   The resurrection of players after level 50 requires the help of
a god.  This help can be received by going to one of the four Temples
Of The Dead.  

Players:  The spell costs 150,000 gold coins and 1 CON point is
          subtracted from the resurrected character for characters
          under level 50.  Then the cost is 15,000 per level.  Because
          the gods are involved in the resurrections of the higher level
          players, there is a chance no damamge will be done to the
          characters body(so, possibly no loss of con).
          

Monsters: The spell costs 2,000 gold coins per level of monster.  The monster
	  will follow the caster for as long as the caster can mantain the 
	  spell's mana consumption (See LEECH). There is no guarantee the 
	  resurrected monster will follow you, it may just thank you.

"DUAL WIELD"

Type:   warrior/thief
Level:  10/15

  It is possible for thieves and warriors to wield two weapons at the
same time, thus doubling the number of attacks the get.  Only certain
weapons may be held in the off-hand and you may not equip both a
second weapon and a shield.  To use a second weapon, just hold or grab
it. Dexterity is a key factor in being able to pull off this tricky
maneuver.

  4 attacks/round = 2 dual wield attacks at dual wield skill percentage
  3 attacks/round = 2 dual wield attacks, 1@dual wield skill percentage
                                          1@dual wield skill percentage/2
  2 attacks/round = 1 dual wield attack at dual wield skill percentage
  1 attack/round  = 1 dual wield attack at dual wield skill percentage/2

Note that pure warriors, having specialized in this type of close combat, can
go even higher than these numbers, rendering a major series of hits per round.

***Note: You may punch occasionally if your dual wield hand is free.

"DEATH"

  According to the christians, death is when you meet your maker and
find out whether you spend eternity comfortable or hot.  The vikings
say that it's when you get to go to valhalla and an eternity of
fighting glorious battles.

  Enough of philosophy, however.  Here in these lands, you lose 1
level and some experience when you die.  Exactly how much you lose
depends on whether or not you had enough to gain when you died.  If
you did, you will be 1 exp short of gaining after you die.  If you did
not, you will have 0 exp after you die.

  The morgue keepers servants will generally retrieve your corpse 
and relinquish it unto you for a small fee.  Any money they found on
your corpse will be automatically deposited into your bank account.

The morgue is located just south of the entrance to the cleric guild.

  In either case, a "resurrection" will undo the effects of dying.

NOTE: Corpses are non-rentable.  This means get your stuff immediately
out of the corpse.  Don't carry equipment around inside your corpse.
Don't rent at reception when equipment in your corpse.  Any of these
can and will cause you to lose equipment.

their physical energy and temporary increase the speed of their attack.
For one round, the monk receives 1 additional attack for 12 levels of 
experience. These bonus attacks are cumulative with melee levels and
spells affecting the speed (Haste, Slow etc.).

But be warned - sometimes the monk fails to properly channel his energy and,
while still receiving additional attacks, he loses even more stamina.
Observation shows that more experienced, wise and agile monks have lesser 
chances of losing additional stamina.

*note* This is an aggressive act and will result in a fight whether
       you are successful or not.
