The room of Raist the Real!~
You stand in a empty room except for a small table at one end. All around you can hear mumbling, seemingly coming from the walls
There is a small slightly confused man in front of the desk roaming around in endless stacks of paper.
As you arive he looks up, a slightly befuddled look on his face as he surpringly see's you standing there.
